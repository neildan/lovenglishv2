                                Welcome to Narnia, my friend. This is the paradise of English learning. First, you‚Äôre
                                going to learn a lot of English through these stories, of course. I have prepared
                                mini‚Äêstories with questions which are the favorite types of lessons for most of my
                                students, but the content, the focus, the topics in these stories are going to be
                                focused on the psychology of learning and the psychology of success.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Now these ideas, they‚Äôre not just my ideas. In fact, they come from a lot of other
                                people. They come from people like Tony Robbins, who is a famous success coach, Robert
                                Anton Wilson, Joe Vitale, Robert Kiyosaki, Alan Watt etc., so I‚Äôve taken a lot of ideas
                                from a lot of different people about this topic of the psychology of success. And the
                                reason that we‚Äôre going to talk about this in these stories is that in my experience,
                                most English students struggle and fail because of psychology, not because of methods,
                                not because of teachers.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Those things are important, but Tony Robbins talks about the fact that psychology is 80%
                                of success. And I think he‚Äôs right, based on my experience with many, many latinamerican
                                English students. Psychology is 80% of success, so 20% are the methods you use to study.
                                But the other 80% is psychology, your motivation, your emotions, how you manage your
                                time. All of these things are in fact much, much more important.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                What I've experienced as an English coach over the years is that the enthusiastic
                                students, the energetic students, the optimistic students always learned much faster.
                                They succeeded. The ones who failed, the ones who dropped out and quit, the ones who
                                struggled had the opposite mentality. They had a very negative mentality. Their
                                motivation was low. They tended to be pessimistic. They felt that they weren‚Äôt good at
                                English. They had ideas that English was very tough, very difficult, they struggled.
                                They didn‚Äôt have enthusiasm for English. They didn‚Äôt love English.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So in these stories we‚Äôre going to talk about how you can manage your emotions, how you
                                can develop that strong, powerful, enthusiastic attitude towards English and how you can
                                maintain it so that you don‚Äôt get bored.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                The idea is that as you go through these stories, you get stronger and stronger with
                                English and your psychology gets stronger and you succeed, you reach your goals. You
                                speak fluently, effortlessly. So among teachers, English teachers, language teachers,
                                this topic is called Non-Linguistic Factors. Non‚ÄêLinguistic Factors.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So what ‚ÄúNon‚ÄêLinguistic Factors‚Äù means is things that are not related to language
                                learning directly. When we talk about language learning research, when we talk about the
                                best methods to use when you learn English, those are linguistic factors, right? They
                                are related to the language. Non‚Äêlinguistic factors means not related to the language.
                                This has nothing to do with English, it‚Äôs more about psychology. Motivation, for
                                example, is a non‚Äêlinguistic factor. So all it really means is just emotional factors.
                                And there are actually many research studies about this topic.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Dr. Stephen Krashen, a scientist in language acquisition and language learning, has done
                                many studies and he has also looked at many studies and he‚Äôs found that non‚Äêlinguistic
                                factors are equally or in fact more important than the linguistic factors to determine
                                who is ultimately successful. What that means is that things like your emotions, things
                                like your close group of friends, the community that you belong to, your feelings about
                                English are as important or more important than the methods you‚Äôre using to learn
                                English.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So how are we going to do this? How are we going to learn? Well, one of the things we
                                have to do is create a daily English ritual. You need to engage your physiology. That
                                means you need to engage and use your body. You need to engage and use your
                                subconscious. That‚Äôs how you start to affect and strengthen your psychology. So we have
                                to strengthen our psychology, what does that mean? Really it means affecting your body
                                and your mind at the same time, so that you actually feel better. Your emotions are
                                happier while you‚Äôre learning English. And I know this is the opposite of what you
                                learned in school.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                You probably didn‚Äôt feel very happy when you were sitting in your English classes. But
                                when you‚Äôre learning with me, it‚Äôs very important for you to feel happy, for your body
                                to feel good, for your mind to feel good. It's very important for you to emotionally
                                enjoy the process of learning English. Of course, it‚Äôs just more fun, you‚Äôre going to
                                like it a lot better. But the other benefit is that you actually will learn faster.
                                You‚Äôll improve your grammar faster, you‚Äôll improve your pronunciation faster. You‚Äôll
                                remember vocabulary words better, longer and faster when you feel good. So there‚Äôs a
                                very practical reason for doing this, too.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So we‚Äôre going to talk a lot in detail in these stories about how to do this. But just
                                right now, during this introduction, let‚Äôs talk a little bit about a daily plan.
                                Something you could do immediately, right now, today, to start improving your success
                                with English by changing your psychology. So here‚Äôs a little ritual, a little plan you
                                can follow every day to start improving, to start feeling better and therefore improve
                                your motivation and to learn English faster and faster and faster, better and better and
                                better. And it‚Äôs very simple.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So the first thing you‚Äôre going to do is when you get up in the morning, the first part
                                of this plan, this daily plan. You want to get into a peak emotional state. Peak means
                                top. For example, the top of a mountain, when we talk about a top of a mountain, the
                                very top we call the peak. So we‚Äôre saying a peak emotional state means a top emotional
                                state or top emotional feeling. It means you want to feel great. Not just good, you want
                                to feel really great. That‚Äôs the first thing you need to do before you listen to any
                                English content. Before you study or use any of my methods that you have learnt in
                                Programa RAIO, you want to first be sure that you feel great.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                How can you do it? Well, it‚Äôs really easy. I recommend, for example, using music. And I
                                actually do this myself in the morning, most mornings. I will put on some great,
                                exciting music that I love in Spanish, jump around, act like a crazy person, and get
                                myself feeling energetic and happy. Do that first before you listen. So move your body,
                                smile. We‚Äôre going to talk about this more in detail in later stories. But just for now,
                                every morning when you get up, first put on some music. Some energetic, happy music that
                                you like, smile, move around. Do that for maybe 5 minutes, maybe 10 minutes. Then when
                                you‚Äôre feeling really great, your body is moving, you feel like you have energy, you‚Äôre
                                happy, then start with the stories, the methods, the voice messages to your native
                                friends etc.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                The first thing you want to listen to is the main explanation, the main audio. So the
                                first thing is listen to the main talk. And you can read this as well the first time if
                                you cannot understand easily, you can read the transcript and listen at the same time.
                                Do this perhaps two times per day, starting with the main story and reading along. Use
                                the Cambridge dictionary or the Reverso.net chrome extension if you need to to look up
                                new words.

                                tell the story. Why am I doing this? Students ask me ‚ÄúWhy are the questions so easy?‚Äù
                                Well, the questions are supposed to be easy because I want you to answer fast and
                                automatically. I want you to train your brain, teach your brain to answer very quickly.
                            </p>

                                I don‚Äôt want you to translate from your language to English or from English to your
                                language. It‚Äôs a bad habit, it will make you speak very slowly. I want you to just
                                answer quickly, automatically, very fast. So that‚Äôs why I ask so many questions, like
                                questions again, again, again, again, again...very easy. Your job: answer the questions
                                quickly. You can answer with only one or two words, its okay. Short answers are fine.
                                You don‚Äôt need to answer with a big, long sentence. In fact, short is better. That's how
                                we mostly respond to questions in real life, right?
                            </p>

                                explanation of the topic first, one or two times so that you understand the concept and
                                the sense of morality of the following mini-story. You can read as well if you need to.
                                Look up words and sentences you don't know. Revise them quickly, just in time. And then,
                                you‚Äôre going to listen to the mini‚Äêstory one or two times or more first. You can also
                                read theat last transcript for the mini‚Äêstory in the beginning. And then finally, you
                                will listen to the mini-story again, this time answering simple questions to practise
                                your automatic, fluent understanding and speech.

                                Don‚Äôt struggle to memorize. Just relax and listen. If necessary, you can read as well,
                                as I said if you need to. But relax, you‚Äôre not trying to memorize anything. Just let it
                                come in. Let the English come into your ears and into your eyes. Don‚Äôt think about it.
                                Don‚Äôt analyze it. Do not think about grammar. The mini‚Äêstories will help you learn
                                grammar subconsciously, so don‚Äôt interrupt that process by trying to analyze it. Don‚Äôt
                                think about grammar rules. NEVER think about grammar rules.

                                like native speakers cannot explain grammar rules. But that‚Äôs okay, you want to be able
                                to use them correctly. That‚Äôs the important part. So again, you want to relax. Do not
                                study. Do not think about grammar rules. Do not try to translate entire sentences, just
                                enough so that you understand the context if needed. Just relax and listen. It should be
                                effortless. You should be smiling, relaxed and just listening.

                                And finally, a very, very important point. You need to use my deep learning method. That
                                means you listen to each story set for one week or more. There are 3 sets in every
                                section; The explanation, the mini-story and the mini-story with questions. Well those
                                three, you want to listen to those three every day for seven days. You want that
                                repetition.

                                Repetition is very important. You want it to go deeply into your brain. Just one time is
                                not enough. Even if it is very easy for you, if you listen you understand everything,
                                it‚Äôs simple, still follow the deep learning method. Still listen to the whole set for
                                one week or more. On the other hand, if it seems very difficult, listen longer. Two
                                weeks is okay. Doesn‚Äôt matter, the point is you want it to go very deeply into your
                                brain which means you want it to be almost effortless. It‚Äôs going to just go into your
                                brain and eventually just come out without you thinking and that requires deep learning.
                                It requires a lot of repetition.

                                Okay, welcome to the main audio for ‚ÄúEmotional Mastery.‚Äù So let‚Äôs talk about emotional
                                mastery in more detail now.
                                How can you manage your emotions, how can you control, I don‚Äôt like the word control,
                                but let‚Äôs just say manage your
                                emotions so that you feel better and stronger while you‚Äôre learning English. So it‚Äôs
                                easy to say that ‚ÄúOh, feel good
                                when you‚Äôre learning English,‚Äù but unfortunately a lot of people feel bad when they‚Äôre
                                learning English. A lot of
                                people feel bored. Or maybe just in your life in general, you‚Äôre tired, you‚Äôre working
                                hard, and it‚Äôs difficult to
                                learn English also and still feel energetic and happy.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So we have to learn some techniques, some methods to manage our emotions, to make sure
                                our emotions are feeling
                                strong while we‚Äôre learning. And remember, again, that emotion and psychology are 80% of
                                success. And a lot of
                                people talk about this in the academic world. Dr. Stephen Krashen, again he‚Äôs the top
                                expert on language
                                acquisition, language learning and language education, and he talks about this idea of
                                non‚Äêlinguistic factors. Which
                                basically means psychological and emotional factors, that they‚Äôre more important than
                                the method you‚Äôre using. Tony
                                Robbins, the famous peak performance coach, talks about this as well. He says directly
                                success comes from emotion,
                                80% of success is emotion. The other 20% is the method, it‚Äôs how you do it.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So we‚Äôve got to master our emotions to master English. How are you going to do to that?
                                Let‚Äôs talk about that now.
                                There are two keys to emotional mastery. One is your physiology, again it‚Äôs your body,
                                how you use and manage your
                                body. And second is your focus, your mental focus. Now a lot of this comes from again
                                Tony Robbins and Joe Vitale
                                and some other peak performance coaches so I‚Äôm using their information and I‚Äôm applying
                                it, I‚Äôm focusing it on this
                                process of learning English and how can you take those ideas and use them to increase
                                your English learning power,
                                so you learn faster, so that you speak better. So again we have two ways to manage our
                                emotions. One is physiology,
                                through the body. And the other is through focus, mental focus. What you think about
                                again and again and again.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                In this lesson we‚Äôre going to talk about physiology, managing physiology. So this is an
                                easy way to change your
                                emotional state. So let‚Äôs imagine that you are tired. You‚Äôve gone to work, you‚Äôve worked
                                a very long day. You‚Äôre
                                tired. And you‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to study English.‚Äù How can you change that
                                feeling? Well you can try to
                                talk to yourself ‚ÄúOh, I should study, I should study, I should feel better,‚Äù but usually
                                that doesn‚Äôt work, right?
                                Usually you still feel tired. What you have to do is start with your body. Change your
                                body. What does your body
                                look like when you‚Äôre tired?
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Usually your shoulders are going to be forward. Is your head going to be up or is your
                                head going to be down? Well,
                                usually when you‚Äôre tired you‚Äôre head is going to be a little bit down, your chin will
                                be kind of down. What about
                                your face? Will you have a big smile on your face or will your face be kind of loose?
                                Well, it‚Äôs usually going to be
                                more use, right? You‚Äôre not usually smiling big when you feel tired. And your eyes,
                                where are your eyes looking
                                usually when you‚Äôre tired? Again, down. So the whole body tends to be forward and down
                                when you feel tired. So an
                                easy, very simple way to change how you feel, how you physically feel, your emotion and
                                in your body is to just make
                                small changes in the way you‚Äôre using your body.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Try it now. Lean forward. Put your shoulders forward. Put your chin down. Look down. Put
                                your body into a tired
                                position, notice how you feel. Now let‚Äôs change it. Pull your shoulders back and your
                                chest up. Bring your chin up.
                                Bring your eyes up. Look up. And now, even if you don‚Äôt feel happy, I want you to smile
                                really big. Put a big smile
                                on your face, fake it. Look stupid. Okay, so a big smile, shoulders back, chest up, eyes
                                up and a big stupid smile,
                                a big grin, on your face. Do you feel differently now? You probably do.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Just by changing the position of your body, I‚Äôm doing it right now myself, I can feel
                                that I feel more energetic. I
                                feel happier just by shifting my body. When I go back and I put my shoulders forward and
                                my chin down and my eyes
                                down, I can feel some energy going down, right? The energy in my body gets less. When I
                                pull my shoulders back, my
                                chest up, my chin up, my eyes up, I‚Äôm smiling big, just faking it, acting like a crazy
                                person, I feel much better.
                                And you do, too. So that is such an easy way to change how you feel, to change your
                                emotional state just by shifting
                                your body. It‚Äôs a simple way to get control of your emotions and to master your
                                emotions.
                            </p>

                                So here‚Äôs what I want you to do. Every time you listen to these lessons or any English
                                lessons or any kind of
                                English studying, I want you to first change your body. Before you listen to those
                                lessons and while you‚Äôre
                                listening, I want you to think about, consciously think about pulling your shoulders
                                back, pushing your chest up,
                                chin up, eyes up, and make yourself smile. You probably didn‚Äôt smile much in your
                                English classes when you were
                                younger but this time I want you to smile even if you feel like you are being stupid. It
                                doesn‚Äôt matter, do it.
                            </p>

                                You‚Äôre going to change your body and by changing your body you‚Äôre going to feel better,
                                you‚Äôre going to have more
                                energy. And when you have more energy, when you feel better, you learn faster. There‚Äôs a
                                lot of research about this.
                                And it shows that people who have more energy, who are feeling good emotionally, learn
                                faster. People who are tired
                                and bored learn much more slowly.

                                What‚Äôs another way that you can change your emotion by changing your body? Well another
                                very easy way is through
                                breathing. How you breathe determines the energy in your body and how you feel. So for
                                example if you have a very
                                shallow breath, you‚Äôre breathing very shallowly...small little breaths...tight chest.
                                You‚Äôre going to feel different
                                than if you‚Äôre taking big breaths that are deep...that was just two breaths, already I
                                can feel in my body a lot
                                more energy. So taking deep breaths, it‚Äôs such a simple way and yet it‚Äôs very powerful.
                                That‚Äôs why in a lot of
                                spiritual traditions, in Buddhism for example, and also in martial arts, in sports, you
                                find that they will focus on
                                breathing. They will tell their students to breathe more deeply. They have a very kind
                                of controlled way of
                                breathing because they know by breathing very deeply they can change their emotional
                                state and their physical state.
                                Increase their energy. Increase the aliveness in their brain, the alertness in their
                                brain.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So this is another thing I want you to do before you learn English. Any kind of
                                studying, these lessons or a book,
                                anything, I want you to focus on breathing deeply. Maybe just two minutes, for two
                                minutes I want you to take deep
                                breaths. Hold it for maybe 2, 3, 4 seconds and then let it out. Then do it again. Hold
                                it...and breathe out...and
                                again and again, 1 or 2 minutes deep breathing. Of course at the same time remember
                                you‚Äôre changing how your body is
                                moving and how you‚Äôre sitting.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                You‚Äôre changing your posture. Of course posture means body position so you‚Äôre going to
                                have a strong posture. It
                                means you‚Äôre going to have the shoulders back, your chin up, your eyes up, chest out.
                                That‚Äôs number one. And then
                                number two you‚Äôre going to breathe deeply. Hold...and out...and again. So again, strong
                                posture, shoulders back,
                                chin up, eyes up and then deep breathing. Do this for 1 or 2 minutes every time before
                                you listen to my stories. I
                                know it seems crazy, it seems so simple and yet it will totally change the way you feel
                                while you‚Äôre learning.
                                Because you will feel differently you will learn differently.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Just this simple, simple technique can increase your learning by two or three times, two
                                or three times faster
                                because your brain will be awake when you‚Äôre listening to English. When you‚Äôre bored,
                                when you‚Äôre tired, your brain
                                is half asleep. You‚Äôre just not learning efficiently. When you‚Äôre breathing deeply and
                                your body is in a strong
                                posture you feel better and you learn faster.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Of course the next factor we already talked about a little bit is your face. You gotta
                                control your face. Why?
                                Because your face shows emotion. But your face also can create emotion. Just by smiling
                                big, pretending, looking
                                like a stupid person, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Just by faking it, just by making yourself
                                smile bit you‚Äôll actually change
                                your emotion. You‚Äôll change your feeling. It‚Äôs very hard to feel depressed and tired
                                when you have a big smile, even
                                if you‚Äôre forcing the smile.
                            </p>

                                So that‚Äôs another thing I want you to do. Everyone on the train will think you‚Äôre crazy
                                while you‚Äôre listening to me
                                but I want you to have a big smile every time while you‚Äôre listening to the lessons.
                                Right now, do it. So you‚Äôre
                                going to have a strong posture. You‚Äôre going to breathe deeply. And you‚Äôre going to
                                smile big, every time, before,
                                during and after these stories.
                            </p>

                                What‚Äôs another way we can control our physiology and therefore influence our emotional
                                state? Well another thing
                                about the body is the body likes to move so we‚Äôre going to talk about movement. You‚Äôre
                                going to have a strong
                                posture.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                You‚Äôre going to breathe deeply. You‚Äôre going to have a big grin on your face, smiling.
                                And then you‚Äôre going to
                                move. Because movement creates energy and energy wakes up your body so that you learn
                                faster. I mentioned this in
                                the introduction a little bit. We‚Äôre going to talk about it more now in detail.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                You should always be moving your body while you‚Äôre learning English. This is the
                                opposite of everything you learned
                                in school. In school they told you ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move. Sit in your chair.‚Äù Right, so you‚Äôre
                                sitting in your chair and what
                                happened? Your body became stiff, you became tired. You were bored. Well this is the
                                opposite. You‚Äôre not in school
                                anymore. You‚Äôre learning independently and it means you‚Äôre in control now. And so I want
                                you to do the opposite of
                                what happened in school.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                I want you to move your body every time you‚Äôre learning English. This can be very
                                simple. If you‚Äôre sitting in a
                                train, okay, it‚Äôs hard to walk around. So you could just stretch your body. Consciously
                                stretch, stretch your leg a
                                little bit. Stretch your arm. Move your head around in a circle. Small little stretches,
                                just make sure your body is
                                moving even a little bit. Even better is to go for a walk. You have a phone. You‚Äôre
                                listening to the lessons. Get
                                outside. Walk on the street. Walk in the woods. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Get out and walk.
                                Move your body. Keep your
                                posture strong while you‚Äôre walking. Shoulders back, chin up, eyes up, chest
                                up...breathe deeply while you walk. And
                                of course, smile big while you‚Äôre walking.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Everyone will think you‚Äôre crazy. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Use this system. I promise you
                                you‚Äôre going to have a totally
                                different experience while you‚Äôre learning English.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Nothing like the schools you went to before. So it‚Äôs very important. If you want to, if
                                you love to exercise, you
                                can run while you‚Äôre learning English. Put on your running shoes. Get some exercise in
                                your body at the same time
                                that you‚Äôre learning. You can do two things at the same time. So walk or run. Keep that
                                body moving at the same time
                                always. It‚Äôs going to keep energy coming into your body, flowing into your body. That
                                wakes up your brain and that
                                makes you learn so much faster. Another idea is go to the gym. Bring your phone again
                                and work out, lift weights or
                                do whatever you do at the gym. Again you‚Äôre using your body, engaging your body at the
                                same time.
                            </p>

                                Okay so let me just review very quickly how you‚Äôre going to use physiology to master
                                your emotions. Number one,
                                posture. Shoulders back, chin up, eyes up, chest up. Number two, breathing...deep, deep
                                breathing. Number three,
                                your face. A big smile every time you‚Äôre learning English. Even if you feel terrible, I
                                don‚Äôt care. Smile big while
                                you‚Äôre listening to these lessons. And then finally, number four, movement.

                                You‚Äôre always going to be moving your body somehow. If you‚Äôre in your car, if you‚Äôre in
                                the train or the bus, you‚Äôre
                                going to maybe make small movements. But ideally the best thing to do is to be outside
                                walking, moving that body, or
                                in the gym, or even running.

                                So you‚Äôre going to change your physiology. Now what happens if after maybe 20 minutes,
                                30 minutes, you start to feel
                                tired again. You‚Äôre listening to the lesson and you‚Äôre starting to get a little bored

                                you need to do is just wake your body up again so pause. Pause that lesson. Stop. Give
                                yourself a little break.
                                Change. Listen to some exciting fun music again. Get up, dance around, move, smile big,
                                get your posture strong
                                again, breathe more deeply. Wake up your body, maybe for 5 minutes...and then back to
                                the lesson again. Do this
                                every time.

                                Hello and welcome to the next story, ‚ÄúFocus‚Äù. So in Emotional Mastery we learned about
                                changing our physiology, changing our bodies to change our emotions. Remember in that
                                less I said there are two ways to change your emotions. Number one is physiology,
                                we talked about that. There is something else you can change so you can be in a peak
                                emotional state as you learn English and that is your focus, your mental focus. What you
                                think about consistently, that will change your emotion also. So what do
                                I mean by mental focus? How do you change your mental focus? What should you focus on?
                                What should you not focus on?
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                First, let‚Äôs talk about the negative. What should you not focus on? Try to remember when
                                you were in school in your English classes. What did you focus on when you were in
                                school? What did you think about, worry about, consistently, frequently? Well probably
                                tests, right? That was one I always thought about. You probably were focused on tests a
                                lot. ‚ÄúI gotta pass this test, I gotta pass this test.‚Äù Tests, and then grades.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                ‚ÄúWill I get an A? Will I get a B? Will I get a C? Will I fail this course?‚Äù So you were
                                thinking about judgment, other people judging you, the teacher judging you, getting a
                                grade, getting a score. How did you feel about that? When you think about tests,
                                tests, tests a lot and you think a lot about a score, a grade, A, B, C.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Or maybe now you‚Äôre thinking about the TOEFL exam and you‚Äôre worried ‚ÄúWhat number will I
                                get on the TOEFL exam?‚Äù How does that affect your emotions? Do you feel more relaxed or
                                more stressful? Well, most people feel more stressful, of course. The more
                                you think about judgment, the more you think about a test score, the more nervous you
                                become, the more worried you become. And that‚Äôs not good. You actually learn more slowly
                                when you‚Äôre worried. You learn more slowly when you‚Äôre nervous, when you
                                have anxiety.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Again, I‚Äôll talk about Dr. Stephen Krashen, our favorite researcher. Anxiety is a major
                                part of his research. It is the single number one most negative factor in language
                                acquisition, in language learning. Anxiety means worry or stress and there are many,
                                many studies about this. They study different language learners, study different English
                                learners. And they put them in a situation where they are more stressed or more worried.
                                And they have others that are in a more relaxed situation. And the relaxed
                                students always learn better and faster.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So let‚Äôs say after six months the relaxed students will have better grammar, better
                                pronunciation, better listening and understanding, better writing skill, better
                                everything. The anxious students, the worried, nervous students, the stressed students,
                                of course, have worse pronunciation, worse speaking ability, less vocabulary, worse
                                writing, less listening comprehension, listening understanding. So what was happening in
                                school was you were actually learning to fail. You were training yourself
                                to be stressed and nervous. You were training yourself to focus on things, tests,
                                grades, teacher‚Äôs opinion of you, that make you feel nervous and that nervousness made
                                you learn more slowly. So you don‚Äôt want to focus on that.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Something else you don‚Äôt want to focus on. You don‚Äôt want to focus on every small step
                                to reach your goal. Your goal is to speak excellent English, to feel strong and
                                confident when you speak. That‚Äôs a great goal. But what happens if you focus on
                                everything
                                you must do to reach the goal? For example, you think ‚ÄúOh god, to become a great speaker
                                that means I‚Äôve got to study every day. I‚Äôve got to learn a lot of words. I‚Äôve got to
                                listen to 2 or 3,000 hours of English.‚Äù How does that make you feel? Probably
                                a little nervous, probably stressed, right, you think ‚ÄúOh my god, it‚Äôs too much.‚Äù So you
                                want to focus on the little individual steps because it‚Äôs going to seem huge, it‚Äôs going
                                to seem so big it‚Äôs going to kill your motivation.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                What else do you not want to focus on? Problems. Problems, so many students focus on
                                problems. So many students come to me and say ‚ÄúKale, my pronunciation is bad. Kale, I
                                make grammar mistakes.‚Äù Well, of course you do. You‚Äôre a student. You‚Äôre learning.
                                It‚Äôs normal. You‚Äôre going to make mistakes. You‚Äôre going to have problems sometimes.
                                You‚Äôre going to make a mistake with your pronunciation. I do, I‚Äôm a fluent speaker, I‚Äôm
                                an English coach. I make mistakes all the time. It‚Äôs normal. You can‚Äôt focus
                                on it. If you focus on it, if you focus on the negative, if you focus on mistakes, if
                                you focus on problems your emotions become weaker and weaker. You actually get worse. So
                                you just need to relax about this. Everybody is human. Everybody makes mistakes.
                                It‚Äôs a normal thing.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Finally, you do not want to focus on the past. Most of my students have very negative
                                experiences with English from the past. Most did not enjoy their English classes in
                                school. When I ask about their past with English ‚ÄúOh, oh, it was terrible.‚Äù People
                                tell me, students tell me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good at English. I was always bad in my English
                                classes. I‚Äôve studied for 6 years, 8 years, 10 years, still I cannot speak well.‚Äù
                                Focused on the past, well the past is not the same as the present. The past doesn‚Äôt
                                equal the future as Tony Robbins likes to say.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                And it‚Äôs true. In the past you used very old traditional methods that made you feel bad.
                                Sitting in a class still, not moving, being graded and tested constantly. Studying
                                boring grammar textbooks, that‚Äôs not a method for success for most people. Some
                                people succeed with that but very few. So the past was different. You‚Äôre now learning in
                                a very different way. You are different now. Don‚Äôt focus on the past.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Alright, so enough of what not to do. What should you focus on if you want to be happy,
                                if you want to be excited, if you want to learn very quickly, faster than before. What
                                should you focus on? What should you think about consistently all the time?
                                Well number one, instead of focusing on the little steps and all the little problems,
                                instead focus on the end result. The final result, that‚Äôs what you need to focus on.
                                Focus on your ultimate success.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So in other words use your imagination and see yourself, imagine yourself speaking
                                English fluently, quickly. Imagine yourself smiling as you speak English with a native
                                speaker. Imagine yourself feeling strong and confident as you speak English easily,
                                effortlessly. Every day focus on this thought, the end result. What you will ultimately
                                reach, ultimately achieve, what you will finally do. Focus on the end result every day,
                                the final result. Do not focus on the little steps you must take every
                                day. Focus on the final result every day.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Second, focus on the purpose, the reason you are learning English. I mean why? If your
                                purpose is to take the TOEFL exam, you‚Äôre going to be stressed and depressed. Nobody is
                                excited about a test, nobody I know. That‚Äôs not a good emotional thing to focus
                                on. It‚Äôs not a good reason to learn English. Taking a test is a terrible reason because
                                it makes you feel stressed, nervous, tired and bored. You need bigger, better reasons.
                                Yes, maybe you need to take the TOEFL exam but why? Why do you want to pass
                                the TOEFL exam? Maybe you want a great job that requires English, where you can use
                                English in international trade perhaps.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Maybe you want to study in the United States, go to a University in the United States,
                                have a great adventure in another country. Well that makes you feel good, right,
                                thinking about that? Imagine yourself in New York City or in San Francisco, meeting
                                native speakers, talking effortlessly, easily. Making new friends, a great new job with
                                more money, now those are great things to focus on. So you want to focus on compelling
                                strong reasons why you‚Äôre learning English, why it‚Äôs important, the benefits,
                                things that make you feel great. Do not focus on a test, please.
                            </p>

                                So those are the two things, you focus on the end result and they‚Äôre related, they‚Äôre
                                basically the same thing. Number two you focus on the reasons why, the purpose. So you
                                have to imagine very vividly, very strongly in your head what it is you will finally
                                do. See the end result. And then feel the emotions. The last step is you want to see the
                                end result with emotion, let yourself feel that it‚Äôs real. So when you focus on speaking
                                great English, feel the emotions. Feel proud. Feel happy. Feel confident.
                                Smile big. Imagine how you will feel speaking excellent English.

                                Okay, so let‚Äôs review very quickly about focus. The main thing about focus, it‚Äôs very,
                                very simple. You‚Äôre going to focus on the end result, the final result. You want to
                                focus on the thing that makes you feel great, the situation, the benefits, all the
                                great things that will improve in your life by speaking excellent English. That‚Äôs what
                                you need to focus on every day. Write it down. Write down, make a list of all the great
                                things that will happen in your life when you speak excellent English.

                                Beliefs are another important part of managing your psychology, of strengthening your
                                psychology so that you will learn English, or anything in fact, much faster. And there
                                are two kinds of beliefs
                            </p>

                                Limiting and empowering beliefs
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Let‚Äôs talk about limiting beliefs first. Now limiting means, limit is something that
                                stops you. It‚Äôs like a boundary. It stops you from going ahead. So a limiting belief is
                                a belief that stops you from improving, a belief that stops you from getting better.
                                And I‚Äôd say most English students have limiting beliefs and many English students have
                                very strong limiting beliefs. I call these beliefs English trauma. My students have told
                                me ‚ÄúKale, I can‚Äôt speak English well because I have English trauma.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                What is English trauma? What is that, what are they talking about? Well, trauma means
                                some kind of injury, some kind of hurt. Emotional hurt, deep emotional hurt. So what
                                they mean is that they had some very negative, painful experiences with English
                                in the past. In other words, when they were in school in English classes, even as adults
                                going to other English schools, they had very negative experiences. And all these
                                negative experiences have created some very negative beliefs, some very limiting
                                beliefs. For example, they say ‚ÄúI am not good at English.‚Äù Well, that‚Äôs a belief. It may
                                be true, it may not be true. But it‚Äôs an opinion, it‚Äôs a belief that they have
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Another belief, a very common belief, English is difficult. Or, English is complicated.
                                Well, that‚Äôs just a belief. For me English is very easy, because I‚Äôm a fluent speaker,
                                just like Spanish for you is very easy. You can speak Spanish fluently because
                                you are hispanic, so an american might say ‚ÄúSpanish is difficult,‚Äù and you would say
                                ‚ÄúNo, Spanish is super easy.‚Äù These are just beliefs that come from our experiences. The
                                problem is these limiting beliefs limit us. They in fact do limit us. They
                                stop us from getting better. They cause a lot of problems for us as students, as
                                learners. I've had them, too. As I tried to learn Spanish, for example, I had a lot of
                                these limiting beliefs. I thought ‚ÄúOh, Spanish is so difficult. Spanish is complicated,
                                the people speak 1000 times faster than English speakers."
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                And these beliefs would hurt my motivation. They would lower my energy, and in fact
                                they‚Äôre wrong. They‚Äôre not true. Spanish does not have to be difficult, it does not have
                                to be complicated. A small child, even a small American child, could learn Spanish
                                very effortlessly, very easily. And the reason is, the number one reason is, they don‚Äôt
                                have the limiting beliefs. They can sing songs and play games and enjoy the language,
                                and they‚Äôll learn it so quickly, so easily, they‚Äôll say ‚ÄúSpanish is easy.‚Äù
                                Well, it‚Äôs the same with English for you. You learned in a very painful, difficult way
                                in the past. And so you developed, you created these beliefs in your head. English is
                                difficult. English is boring. English is painful. I‚Äôm not good at English.
                                I‚Äôll never speak excellent English. These are just beliefs
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So how do you eliminate these beliefs? Okay, you have these beliefs. You know they‚Äôre
                                negative, you know they‚Äôre not helping you. But we have to figure out, how can we get
                                rid of the limiting beliefs? That‚Äôs the first step, you have to weaken them. You
                                have to make them weaker and weaker and weaker. You have to cut them down. Well, beliefs
                                get stronger from experiences or memories. Sometimes, it‚Äôs just something you imagine,
                                actually. But it‚Äôs a specific experience or a specific imagination, a specific
                                moment, that makes the belief stronger or weaker
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So, for example, you have this idea ‚ÄúEnglish is painful and boring.‚Äù And when you think
                                of this belief, where does it come from? Well, you think of all these past experiences.
                                You think of the time in middle school where your teacher corrected your mistake
                                and you felt terrible. And you think of maybe the bad grades you got on the test. And
                                you start adding more and more and more memories, more of these negative experiences,
                                these negative references. And if you get enough, you will develop a very,
                                strong, deep, powerful belief that "English is difficult. English is painful. I‚Äôm not
                                good at English.‚Äù So to weaken these, you just have to question the experiences
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                You have to question the memories. Take the power away from them. And an easy way to do
                                that is just to ask questions about them. For example, let me ask this question. Your
                                past English schools, were they great? Were they just fantastic English schools
                                with fantastic, amazing, fun, positive English teachers? Did you have a great time every
                                day? Well, I know for most of you the answer is no. So that‚Äôs interesting, so if your
                                schools were not excellent, maybe the school was the problem. Maybe it‚Äôs
                                not you. Maybe your English is not great because you did not go to great schools, or
                                learned from a great teacher. And did those schools that you went to, or the books you
                                used, did they use proven methods
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Did they use research‚Äêbased methods? Did they know a lot about the research about
                                English learning, English teaching? Did they only use the best methods? Or did they just
                                use the textbook that everybody else uses? Well, I know from my experience as a
                                coach, most schools just use the same textbooks. They don‚Äôt know why. Maybe the boss
                                tells them ‚ÄúWe must use this book.‚Äù But they‚Äôre not choosing the very, very best
                                methods. They‚Äôre not choosing the very, very best books. And so maybe the reason
                                you believe English is difficult is because you used difficult methods in the past, or
                                your teachers did. Maybe you think English is boring because in the past you used boring
                                methods. You went to boring schools. You had boring teachers. Maybe English
                                isn‚Äôt the problem. Maybe it was these past experiences. Maybe it was the way you did it
                                or where you did it. Ask yourself these questions. Think about them in detail. Weaken
                                your limiting beliefs. Challenge your limiting beliefs
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Another question, in school did you learn deeply? For example, did you take one chapter
                                in your book and learn it for a long time so that you totally mastered it, so that you
                                knew it completely, 100% and never forgot it ‚Äì as you did with the Movie Strategy?
                                Probably not, most schools, courses and academies I have seen, it‚Äôs quite the opposite.
                                The teachers go very, very, very quickly. You learn one chapter in your book, boom,
                                after one week on to the next one, and the next one. Each chapter has so many
                                new words, so much new grammar
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                For example, my experience with Spanish in high school and university, I studied
                                Spanish, but I forgot it all. Because we never learned deeply. They just tried to make
                                us learn as many words as possible, a lot of words, a lot of words, a lot of grammar,
                                very, very fast. And then, of course, I forgot everything. How about you? Did you learn
                                deeply in your schools? If not, maybe that was one of the problems. Maybe English feels
                                difficult because you never learned deeply. Maybe English is not the problem
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Finally, did you learn with a grammar translation method? Did you study a lot of grammar
                                rules? Did you take a lot of tests? Did you feel good about that? Again, maybe the
                                method was the problem. Maybe the school is the problem, not English
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So think about these questions and think about them every day. Think about them a lot. I
                                want you to think about these questions again and again and again. And really be honest
                                about it. And start to destroy these limiting beliefs. Get rid of them. They‚Äôre
                                wrong. English is not difficult. English is not painful. English is not boring. It‚Äôs
                                only a belief. It‚Äôs only a past experience. You can change that now and in the future

                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So let‚Äôs do that. Let‚Äôs talk now about empowering beliefs, the positive side.

                                So to empower, the verb, to empower means to make stronger. It means to give power to
                                another person. Or in this case, it means that the beliefs give you power. An empowering
                                belief is a belief that makes you feel powerful, that gives you power. That‚Äôs
                                the kind of beliefs you want and you need to choose them.

                                You must decide which beliefs will make you stronger. For example, here‚Äôs an empowering

                                You can replace your old limiting belief and add this one instead:

                                languages. It is designed to learn language. It should be easy. It should be effortless.
                                It should feel good. You learned your native language that way. It wasn‚Äôt difficult
                                was it? Swedish, English and Spanish was easy for me to learn at last, because I found
                                out how to do it in a totally natural way. And the more naturally I tried to improve my
                                Spanish, the easier it feels. So this is a new belief and you should write
                                it down, think about it. Write down this idea, this belief ‚ÄúMy brain is a language
                                learning machine.‚Äù Think about it every day. Decide to choose that belief.

                                English can be fun and effortless. That‚Äôs an empowering belief and it‚Äôs also true. You

                                right? They‚Äôre fun. They‚Äôre stupid, sometimes. They‚Äôre crazy, sometimes. But
                                they‚Äôre not serious. English can be fun and effortless. That‚Äôs an empowering belief you
                                want to choose and you want to remember it every day.

                                I‚Äôll give you one of my favorite examples, Steve Kaufman of The Linguist speaks, I

                                their beliefs. I‚Äôll tell you some of his beliefs right now. Steve believes, for example,
                                that language learning is easy and effortless. That‚Äôs his belief.

                                they‚Äôre not difficult. They‚Äôre easy and effortless. That‚Äôs a very strong belief he
                                has. Another belief he has is that you must learn language naturally and you must focus
                                on meaning. So in other words, he doesn‚Äôt focus on the grammar. He‚Äôs not focusing on
                                boring textbooks. He‚Äôs consuming interesting things that he enjoys. He‚Äôs listening
                                to interesting things that he enjoys. So, for him, language learning is interesting.

                                What‚Äôs really interesting for me is that these are the same beliefs that all of my best
                                students have. They all have these same ideas. The best students, the ones who learn the
                                fastest, the ones who have the best test scores, the ones with the best speaking,
                                they all believe these things. They all believe that English is fun, interesting

                                empowering beliefs, beliefs that give you power about English. Maybe ‚ÄúMy brain is a

                                An incantation is a phrase or sentence that you say again and again. It has almost a
                                magic idea, it comes from magic. An incantation is a magical sentence. It‚Äôs a sentence,
                                if you say the sentence something will happen. That‚Äôs where it comes from. But
                                for us, an incantation is just a belief you are going to repeat again and again and
                                again every day. So here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to do. For example ‚ÄúEnglish can be fun and
                                effortless.‚Äù You‚Äôre going to say that out loud every day while you‚Äôre walking
                                along and you‚Äôre doing your posture. And you‚Äôre breathing and you‚Äôre smiling. Well,
                                you‚Äôre going to add one more thing. As you walk, as you‚Äôre getting ready to learn,
                                you‚Äôre going to repeat this out loud. You‚Äôre going to say ‚ÄúEnglish can be fun and
                                effortless.‚Äù You‚Äôre going to say it with some emotion. Say it with feeling so you‚Äôre
                                smiling, you‚Äôre breathing deep, you‚Äôre moving your body, you have good posture and now
                                you‚Äôre also saying these strong beliefs. English can be fun and effortless.
                                You repeat it again. English can be fun and effortless. And then you say it again.
                                English can be fun and effortless.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                You can do this in your room and it's fine. You can do it outside and make everyone look
                                at you and think you‚Äôre crazy. Why not? It‚Äôs better than feeling powerless, right? It‚Äôs
                                better than being bored. I promise you will learn so much faster if you do
                                this. So do these incantations every day just before you study English with one of my
                                methods. Get your body into a strong, emotional state, and then say these incantations:

                                And what thought mastery is, it‚Äôs controlling and managing your thoughts. And when you
                                control your thoughts, when you manage your thoughts, when you can change your thoughts,
                                you change your motivation. You change your emotion. And that causes you to change your
                                actions. And a lot of what we‚Äôre going to talk about today comes from NLP. That‚Äôs
                                neuro‚Äêlinguistic programming which is a very long word. Neuro means nerve or brain,
                                something to do with the nerves or the brain or the nervous system, neuro. Linguistic
                                we‚Äôve learned already, and you probably understand it super easily since it's a cognate
                                in Spanish, right?
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Linguistic means language. And programming, of course, is similar to programming a
                                computer, telling it something, what to do. So what it talks about is how to program
                                your brain with language and with thoughts and with pictures. That‚Äôs neuro‚Äêlinguistic
                                programming. It was developed by several different people, one of the most famous people
                                is Richard Bandler developed this system called NLP. And NLP is designed to help you
                                kind of control your brain a little better. To decide the kind of images, decide the
                                kind of thoughts you want to have in your brain. And by doing that, by changing your
                                thoughts you will change your emotions and your actions.
                            </p>

                                One of the key techniques of NLP is to take images that you have in your brain and to
                                modify them and change them. So a lot of times we have negative pictures in our head and
                                we don‚Äôt realize how powerful they are, how much they affect us, how they change the way
                                we act, how they change the way we feel. And so what we want to do is look at the
                                pictures that we make in our head and we want to choose them. We want to change them and
                                choose better pictures.

                                Let me give you an example. Let‚Äôs talk about English class, English class. Imagine in
                                your head an English class. What do you see? What picture comes into your head when I
                                say English class? For example, do you see a room with a lot of students in it? Are they
                                sitting at little desks in rows? Are they moving a lot or are they still? What about the
                                teacher? Where is the teacher? Is the teacher at the front of the class standing above
                                the students talking down to them? Do the students look happy? Are they smiling or do
                                they look bored? What about the quality of this picture in your head? Is it bright and
                                happy and colorful? Or is it kind of dark, maybe black and white? Is it loud? Is there
                                music or is it quiet? Or is it silent?
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                All of these qualities of the picture will change your emotional feeling. So, for
                                example, if we take this picture and we imagine this class, this is the image I have in
                                my head when I think English class, and you know, it‚Äôs not a very positive one. It comes
                                from an experience I had in Mexico. It‚Äôs kind of the typical Spanish class that I see in
                                my head whenever I hear that word. It‚Äôs kind of dark, there‚Äôs no movement. It‚Äôs not a
                                happy picture.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So what do I want to do if I want to change my belief about English and English classes?
                                One thing I can do is change the pictures I make in my head. So, for example, we can
                                take that picture, we can change it. We can choose a better picture. Instead I can see a
                                circle of students. Let‚Äôs imagine a circle of students. And then I‚Äôm going to add color.
                                Everybody is wearing nice colorful clothes. And then I imagine everybody smiling, big
                                smiles. And I imagine movement, I add movement to the picture. So now people are up,
                                they‚Äôre jumping around, they‚Äôre moving, they‚Äôre talking. They‚Äôre alive. I add sound. I
                                add happy, talking, smiling, laughing, maybe a little music in the background. I take
                                this happy, colorful picture and I make it bigger in my head. I bring it closer to me
                                and bigger so it fills up everything in front of me. Now do that yourself. Imagine this
                                happy picture of an English class and make it big and colorful, with sound, with
                                laughter, with music. Does it change the way you feel about this word...English class?
                                It probably does.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So we can do this with anything, with any image. And what you do is you take first your
                                negative image, so let‚Äôs go back again to the negative, sad image of an English class.
                                Maybe you can remember one from your past. What we‚Äôre going to do now is look at that
                                negative picture and we‚Äôre going to change it and play around with it. So the first
                                thing I want you to do is make it darker. So you have this picture in your head, it‚Äôs a
                                negative feeling, it‚Äôs a negative memory...make it darker. Make the picture darker in
                                your head. Next, push it away from you. So if it‚Äôs close to you, push it away so that it
                                becomes smaller and smaller and smaller. Keep pushing it away until it disappears to
                                nothing.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                And now suddenly, think of the positive, happy picture. So replace it with the big,
                                large, colorful, loud picture in your head of a happy, fun English class. See it in your
                                head and let yourself feel how you would feel if you were in that picture. So put
                                yourself now into the picture, step into it so now you are in that English class with
                                all these smiling, happy people with all this color, with all this laughter, with all
                                the music. Does that change how you feel? It should, it usually does.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So what you want to do now is program yourself to do this every time. So what you do,
                                you do this same process again and again and again. Maybe 50 times, maybe 100 times. You
                                do it quickly. So, for example, you go back again. Go back to the negative image. Okay,
                                see that negative class, oh, boring, terrible, that old memory you have. And again,
                                quickly, make it darker, make it smaller. Push it away, smaller, smaller, smaller, until
                                it disappears. And now suddenly, boom, see the big, happy, colorful picture again. This
                                great, happy, wonderful English class, and step into the picture again. Feel yourself
                                there with all these people who are laughing and having a great time. See the color.
                                Make it big. Okay, great.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Now back again to the negative one, the old memory. See it again, the old, negative,
                                terrible English class. And again, make it darker. Turn the light down, darker, darker,
                                and then now make it smaller and push it away, farther, farther, farther, until it
                                disappears. Boom! See the big, happy, wonderful English class again, color, laughter,
                                happiness. Step into that picture. Be part of it.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Now you can do this again and again and again. In fact, you could do this every day,
                                maybe 10 times or 20 times. If you‚Äôre really motivated you could do it 100 times in a
                                row at the same time, very fast. You take the negative picture, you shrink it, you make
                                it darker, you push it away. It disappears suddenly, boom, a big, happy, positive,
                                colorful picture. And then you go back to the negative, disappear, boom, a big, happy,
                                colorful, positive picture, again and again and again.
                            </p>

                                So here‚Äôs what happens. What‚Äôs really interesting is when you do this again and again
                                and again you are programming your brain like a computer. So after you do it enough
                                times, in the future when you think English class, or someone says English class,
                                automatically this process happens. Automatically, boom, you see in your head a big,
                                happy, wonderful picture and you feel really good. You‚Äôre teaching yourself to feel good
                                about this phrase or this idea or this experience called English class. And in this way
                                you can totally change your feelings about English or English class.
                            </p>

                                You can do this with any negative memory or negative image you have in your head. If
                                you‚Äôve had several bad experiences with English, take those pictures, take those
                                memories, do this same process. Look at them carefully. Then make them darker, then
                                smaller. Then push them away, and then suddenly, boom, replace them with a big,
                                positive, happy, colorful picture and then join the picture. And back again and again
                                and again and again, you know, probably you need a total of 100 to 200 times, so you can
                                do it very, very fast. It just takes a few seconds, so in 5 minutes or 10 minutes, you
                                could do this 100 times or 150 times. And you‚Äôre programming your brain just like a
                                computer to think in a more positive way. So you can totally change the way you feel
                                about English learning. You can totally change your old, negative memories, beliefs and
                                feelings about English.

                                I‚Äôve seen this myself in my experience as a coach with many of my students. And there‚Äôs

                                That when you‚Äôre happy, when you‚Äôre motivated, when you have strong, positive feelings
                                and thoughts about the language you‚Äôre learning, in this case English, you learn much

                                methods are important, of course. You want to use the best methods, but without the
                                psychology, without the emotion, no method will work successfully. You absolutely must
                                take care of this part of the learning process. You must manage your thoughts, your
                                emotions, your motivation, if you truly want to speak excellent English.

                                darker, smaller, push it away, and then suddenly replace it with a big, strong, positive

                                had to move her body. She was learning with movement.
                            </p>

                                So she used the kinesthetic method for one year. It boosted her learning. She learned
                                faster and faster and better and better. But, but she didn't achieve mastery. She didn't
                                master Swedish. She was good, but not a master.

                                Models are very important, and by model I mean role model, not the models you see on
                                magazines. That‚Äôs a different meaning. A role model is kind of like a hero. It‚Äôs someone
                                that has success, the same kind of success that you want. So, for example, if
                                you are a football player, you want to be great then maybe Ronaldo or Messi is your role
                                model, maybe both. It‚Äôs important to have role models. Role models are people who have
                                done already what you want to do. Why is that important? Well, it‚Äôs important
                                because you can learn from them. You can learn much faster if you find out, if you
                                discover what they did to succeed. This is the fast track for success. You don‚Äôt have to
                                make all the same mistakes. You can copy them in a way and learn much, much
                                faster

                                So, for example, when I started my own business, in the beginning I knew nothing, zero,
                                I had no idea what to do. I was just a normal guy with a passion for languages. Now I
                                had two choices, I could have just tried something, tried something else, kept
                                trying things, trying things, making mistakes, failing, try again. But I wanted to
                                succeed faster. That would be a very slow method if I only experimented, if I only tried
                                and failed, tried and failed, and tried to find everything by myself. So, of
                                course, I wanted to succeed faster, so what did I do? I went and I found role models. I
                                found other people who were already successful business people. I read their books. I
                                went to their seminars and their workshops. I learned everything possible
                                from them. And then I used what I learned with my own business. And in this way I was
                                able to succeed much, much faster. I could take all the great strategies that they were
                                using, that they discovered in their life, maybe with many, many years. I
                                could take all those great strategies and I could use them in months or in weeks

                                Well you can do the same thing with your English learning or with anything. You can find

                                the best ideas, the best strategies, the best methods that they have used,
                                and you can copy those so that you will learn much, much faster. You will make fewer
                                mistakes. So that‚Äôs why role models are so important. They speed up the learning
                                process, they boost it up. They also, of course, give you an emotional boost because
                                you can see that they did it. Somebody already did what I want to do. It proves it‚Äôs not
                                impossible, it can be done. And I also had that a little bit with my business. I was a
                                little bit scared. I didn‚Äôt know much about business. But the more I read
                                about all these other people who started, like me, with no knowledge of business, with
                                no money, but they did certain things and those certain actions led to success. Those
                                certain strategies led to success and I realized if I used the same strategies
                                I will get the same result, the same success. It‚Äôs the same with English learning. If
                                you follow the strategies of people who are masters, you also will become a master,
                                quite simple
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So let‚Äôs talk about this a little bit. In fact, this is how I developed my teaching
                                system, my methodology. I knew nothing at first, zero. I went to Mexico and started
                                studying Spanish, but I didn‚Äôt know anything about language learning. I had a degree
                                in engineering, but that was about it. And I did what most students do, I just grabbed
                                some textbooks and followed the textbooks that the teacher gave me. And the result was
                                not so good. And I did this for a little while before I quit school to study
                                on my own
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                And I began to notice something. I began to notice that a I was learning much faster
                                than everybody else. I was doing much better than everybody else. So I was curious, I
                                wanted to understand why am I learning faster, how am I different than the other
                                students? So I started paying attention to how the other Europeans were trying to learn
                                Spanish. Over time, I began to realize there were patterns.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Me and a few others, the best students, were always doing similar things and they were
                                different than what most students were doing
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                And I started looking at what researchers had found. I started listening and reading
                                articles from scientists who were studying Spanish or, in general, language learning.
                                And I wanted to find out again what were the results, the scientific results that
                                showed which methods were fastest, which methods were best for learning languages
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                And again I began to find patterns and the very interesting thing to me, the patterns
                                were the same as what was happening with me and the rest of the best students. So the
                                research was showing the same thing that me and the other successful students were
                                showing. We were doing exactly the same thing as the research said you're supposed to
                                do. So from these role models, these academic role models, these scientists, and then my
                                actual students, my best students, also role models, I learned a totally
                                new way to teach English. And that is what you have now, the RAIO system, the RAIO
                                approach
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So let me talk about some of these examples and then I will talk in more detail about
                                the importance of finding role models and finding a peer group. So peer means... it‚Äôs a
                                person who‚Äôs equal to you. But a peer, really it means, it‚Äôs the people you have
                                contact with every day. Your coworkers, your friends, business partners, all of those
                                people are your peers, so people you have contact with constantly, every day, the people
                                you see again and again and again, every day, those are your peers. And
                                it‚Äôs important to have a very good peer group. You need to have a good peer group and
                                you need to have good role models
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So first let‚Äôs talk about role models. I just want to talk about a few success stories,
                                a few of my best students that I‚Äôve had over the years. So one of my best students, her
                                name is Andrea, she was and still is a student of mine. She loved listening
                                to English.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Andrea was listening to my stories all the time. She was listening to podcasts, she was
                                listening to television, very focused on listening, an auditory method, learning with
                                her ears, in the car, at work, at home in her couch, everywhere and all the time.
                                She was listening, listening, listening a lot
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Another key thing that Andrea focused on was meaning and interest. In other words, she
                                always chose English materials that were interesting to her that had meaning for her.
                                Textbooks usually don‚Äôt have much personal meaning. So she chose a story ‚ÄúOh,
                                this story is very interesting, I want to watch this video.‚Äù She was focused on the
                                meaning. She was focused on the story. She was not focused on grammar or vocabulary. So
                                that‚Äôs interesting
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Well, later I listened to a guy called Steve Kaufman. Steve Kaufman is a linguist. He
                                speaks, I think he speaks 12 languages now. He keeps adding languages so I forget how
                                many he speaks. But the last time I talked to him he was speaking 12 languages.
                                Not bad. He‚Äôs a Canadian, a native English speaker, but he speaks French, he speaks
                                Japanese, Cantonese and Mandarin. He‚Äôs learning Russian now, he‚Äôs learning Korean. He‚Äôs
                                an amazing guy and, of course, I was very curious about Steve, another great
                                language learning role model. So I stalked him on Social Media..
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So Steve, guess what, same as Andrea. Number one, he has a listening approach.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                He focuses mostly on listening, probably 80% of his time he spends listening. He learns
                                with his ears. Another thing Steve does, he listens for pleasure. He does not focus on
                                grammar, this is another interesting thing. Steve does not study grammar. He
                                might learn a little grammar sometimes like we do with the Reverso.net tool but, in
                                general, he focuses on listening for fun, just like Andrea. Interesting..
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Well I began to see these patterns again and again and again. The superstar learners,
                                the superstar students have these same exact patterns. They‚Äôre great role models and
                                they‚Äôre doing the same things. They seem to always be focused on listening... listening,
                                listening, listening. They focus their listening and their on interesting content,
                                meaningful content. Another interesting thing, they never focus on grammar. They may
                                learn a little bit of grammar, or not. Some of them will study grammar a little
                                bit, some never study grammar. But they all focus totally on listening to interesting
                                content...input, input, input is their focus
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Another interesting thing that you find with these superstar students, these superstar
                                learners, is that they do a lot of deep learning, in other words, a lot of repetition.
                                My favorite example of this is Jerry Dye, a man called Jerry Dye. Jerry was a
                                native Chinese speaker and he moved to Canada. And he wanted to have perfect
                                pronunciation. He wanted to sound like an American. So number one, what did he do? Well,
                                he focused on listening again...listening, listening, listening. Every day he listened
                                to English.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Something else he did very interesting. He learned deeply. It means he took the same
                                article, for example, or the same conversation, he listened to it 100, 200, 300, 400,
                                500 times. Amazing. The same conversation. Why did he do that? I mean it sounds
                                crazy. It‚Äôs very different from what normal students do. Well, because he realized he
                                needed that massive repetition so that he could really learn and absorb all the sounds
                                of English, the patterns of English. He realized that deep learning was more
                                important than going fast and trying to learn a lot of words and a lot of grammar.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Now you don‚Äôt need to do quite so much like Jerry Dye, 500 times with one thing is a
                                little bit much. It‚Äôs kind of hard to stay motivated. It can become quite boring. But
                                the general principle is important, deep learning. It‚Äôs something that all my superstar
                                students do, that the superstar learners do. They learn a lot very deeply first so they
                                go deep, deep, deep, a lot of repetitions, and then later they add more.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Another guy who does a lot of deep learning, one of my favorite examples in my
                                mini‚Äêstories, Tiger Woods, we‚Äôve heard a lot about Tiger Woods. Well, think about Tiger
                                Woods for a minute. Tiger Woods started to practice golf when he was a child. His father
                                taught him golf and he learned how to putt. He would practice putting, right, the little
                                short, little short strokes. And he practiced big, long strokes, driving in golf, it‚Äôs
                                called driving it means hitting it far, the same swing. Tiger Woods has
                                been practicing the exact same swing for years, since he was a small child until now.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                He‚Äôs a master but he still practices his swing. I mean this is super deep learning. He‚Äôs
                                doing the same simple thing again and again and again, each time trying to make a tiny
                                little improvement, right? Tiger didn‚Äôt decide ‚ÄúOh, well, I‚Äôm sick of this,
                                I already know this. I don‚Äôt need to practice anymore.‚Äù That‚Äôs what a lot of English
                                learners do. They say ‚ÄúI already know the past tense. I can take a test, I can pass it,
                                no problem.‚Äù But when they speak they make constant mistakes with the past
                                tense. It‚Äôs because they did not learn it deeply. They know it at a shallow level, they
                                can take a test, but they don‚Äôt know it deeply, deeply, deeply, the way Tiger Woods
                                knows his swing because he‚Äôs done it, I don‚Äôt know, 50,000 times, 100,000 times,
                                maybe more. So deep learning is something else we can learn from our role models. Take
                                the point-of-view stories in Chapter 4, for example. Study those stories 500 times and
                                you'll see how good your grammar will be.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So what you need to do then is find role models. And you can get them from a peer group.
                                Peer group means it‚Äôs the people you associate with, the people you‚Äôre around, the
                                people you connect to every day. How do you find a peer group of super great English
                                learners, of superstar students? Well there are different ways to do it but I think the
                                easiest way to do it is in the Familia RAIO group. I mean the internet is amazing
                                because you can communicate with people all over the world. And you can come
                                together as a group and communicate, learn from each other. And that‚Äôs going to increase
                                your learning speed so much.
                            </p>

                                That‚Äôs one reason we call ourselves Familia RAIO. The family part is equally important
                                to the program. The family part is a peer group, a group of superstar learners so that
                                you can connect with people, other latinos, in different parts of the world who
                                are using these same patterns, these same methods, these same systems. And you can learn
                                from them and so you can learn faster yourself. And another important thing about a peer
                                group is it gives you support, emotional support. When you have other
                                superstars to help you, you learn faster and you feel better.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Sometimes maybe you feel tired. Sometimes you have a problem. Well, you can go to these
                                people, go to your peer group. Go to the Facebook group and tell us ‚ÄúHelp me, I feel
                                tired.‚Äù We will help you. We will encourage you. We‚Äôll bring your energy back
                                up. It‚Äôs very important to do this. Doing something alone is much tougher than doing it
                                with a positive, superstar peer group. So you need to take advantage of the family, a
                                powerful peer group of role models. People who are great English learners,
                                you need to connect with them. Learn from them, do what they are doing. If you do that,
                                I promise you, you will be so much more successful than you have in the past.

                                Okay, that is the end of the mini-story for ‚ÄúModels.‚Äù As always, listen to it many
                                times, deep learning, deep learning, deep learning. I‚Äôll say it one more time...deep
                                learning. I know this seems like repetitive points, but I‚Äôm going to keep saying it
                                every time because you need to learn deeply. Most of these stories are in the past tense
                                because most students need more practice with the past tense. And there are some other
                                tenses mixed in there too sometimes. You don‚Äôt need to know the names,
                                it‚Äôs not important. Don‚Äôt think about it. The important thing is to listen, listen,
                                listen. And you want to answer the questions quickly, quickly, quickly. It‚Äôs okay to
                                just listen. You don‚Äôt need to answer if you don‚Äôt want to, if you‚Äôre on a train
                                or you‚Äôre around other people, you can just listen quietly. But if you want to you can
                                pause and answer the questions, pause and answer the questions. Try to do it quickly.
                                But the important part is repetitive listening, deep, deep learning. You don‚Äôt
                                want to just learn these things, you need to master them.

                                every time because you need to learn deeply. Most of these stories are in the past tense
                                because most students need more practice with the past tense. And there are some other
                                tenses mixed in there too sometimes. You don‚Äôt need to know the names,
                                it‚Äôs not important. Don‚Äôt think about it. The important thing is to listen, listen,
                                listen. And you want to answer the questions quickly, quickly, quickly. It‚Äôs okay to

                                you‚Äôre around other people, you can just listen quietly. But if you want to you can
                                pause and answer the questions, pause and answer the questions. Try to do it quickly.
                                But the important part is repetitive listening, deep, deep learning. You don‚Äôt want to
                                just learn these things, you need to master them.

                                Repetition means doing something again and again and again and again and again. So maybe
                                this is the bad news or the good news, I don‚Äôt know, but the truth is to learn English,
                                to learn any language, to learn any skill, to be a master you have to have
                                a lot of repetition. We've talked about this throughout the programa, consolidation
                                before expansion. And this is something that a lot of people don‚Äôt like and they go ‚ÄúOh
                                my god, I‚Äôm bored. I don‚Äôt want to listen to this again. I don‚Äôt want to do
                                this again and again and again.

                                I‚Äôll give you a small example. I started taking singing lessons a while ago and every
                                lesson we did the same thing. We did these scales, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
                                nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. Every single time. Every day, same scales, same exercises.
                                And anyone who wants to get really good at singing has to do this. You have to repeat.
                                You can‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúOh, I already know this. I did it 10 times so I‚Äôm finished and let‚Äôs
                                do something new.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Unfortunately a lot of people have this idea with language learning for some reason.
                                Most people understand if you learn a sport you have to repeat the same basic actions
                                again and again and again. If you want to be great at basketball, you probably know
                                you have to practice dribbling (which means bouncing the ball), passing and shooting the
                                ball, again and again and again and again. Michael Jordan practiced these same basic
                                skills from a child until he finished his career. What, 20 years maybe, every
                                day practicing the same skills, again and again. And not just practicing, practicing
                                with emotion, practicing with power, practicing with energy, every day for 20 years or
                                more. We‚Äôve already mentioned Tiger Woods a lot, same thing with golf. He practices
                                the same skills again and again and again and again, every single day, years and years
                                and years
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So why, when we‚Äôre learning English or learning a language, do we say ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt want
                                to study this any more, I already know it. I already know the present tense. I already
                                know these words. I already know this grammar. I already know this lesson.‚Äù
                                What, maybe you listened to it 7 times, 5 times? It‚Äôs not enough. We need a lot of
                                repetition, a lot of repetition with power, with intensity. Your whole life, that‚Äôs why
                                babies learn so quickly and so well, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm can speak Spanish he way
                                I do, because every single day, for a very long time, I've been listening to Spanish,
                                the same Spanish over and over again
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Same for you! When you were 5 years old you didn‚Äôt tell your mom ‚ÄúMom, I already know
                                the past tense so stop using it. Let‚Äôs learn something more difficult now. I‚Äôm bored
                                with the past tense.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Of course, that‚Äôs ridiculous, right? You're still hearing the past tense used correctly
                                in Spanish constantly, every single day of your life. And that‚Äôs why you can use the
                                past tense without thinking, totally effortlessly. Because it‚Äôs something you
                                hear again and again and again and again and again and you have since you were born
                                until right now and you need to decide that you‚Äôre going to do this with English, too.
                                So forget this idea of levels. Forget levels, there is no level. You‚Äôre not
                                an advanced English speaker and then suddenly ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt need to worry about the past
                                tense anymore. Oh, I already know the present tense, I‚Äôm an advanced speaker.

                                Well bullshit! It‚Äôs not true. You never finish. And in fact you have to focus on the
                                basic things, the most frequent, core, fundamental, important parts of the language. You
                                have to focus on them every day, you never stop. Yes, you‚Äôll start to learn some
                                advanced vocabulary. Yes, you‚Äôll learn some of that great advanced grammar that you've
                                always wanted to learn. But that stuff is just extra. Always, the core, main focus of
                                your learning must be the fundamentals, the high frequency words, the most
                                common grammar structures that you've heard in Chapter 4 and that you constantly revise
                                for a few minutes in reverso.net, and the basic pronunciation of the language by
                                shadowing, imitating, recording yourself and comparing. You never stop practicing
                                those. You never stop improving them. Every day you continue to focus on them
                            </p>

                                Okay, you believe me? Alright, we agree? Alright, good. Well, your next question is
                                probably how. Because the problem with this is that it gets boring. Right, and you‚Äôre
                                like ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt want to do it again.‚Äù And this is a problem that everybody has.
                                Everyone who wants to be a master has this same exact problem. I‚Äôm sure Michael Jordan
                                at sometime said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of shooting free throws.‚Äù Free throws are the basic, same
                                shot, all basketball players practice them every day for all their life. Probably
                                at some time he decided, ‚ÄúOh man, I‚Äôve already done this 20,000 times, I don‚Äôt want to
                                do it again.‚Äù But then he said, oh, I need to. He realized that he could never stop
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                How does Tiger Woods keep going? How does he continue to practice the same things every
                                day when he‚Äôs already a master? It‚Äôs an emotional problem, right? It‚Äôs a mental problem.
                                It‚Äôs not a physical problem. It‚Äôs easy to do, the problem is we stop wanting
                                to do it. So again, it‚Äôs a problem of our mentality. It‚Äôs a problem of our psychology.
                                And we have to learn how to practice with a lot of repetition but continue to feel
                                strong, continue to have energy and intensity. That‚Äôs the trick. That‚Äôs the secret
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                We‚Äôve already talked about some ways to do this. So one way you do this is to manage
                                your emotions. Manage your peak states. You get in that peak state. That‚Äôs why I keep
                                reminding you...are you smiling? Are you moving? Is your head up? Are your shoulders
                                back? Are you breathing deeply? I continue to remind you about this because it‚Äôs
                                important. It will keep your energy high. It will help you repeat again and again and
                                again without getting bored. When your body, when your physiology is strong, you
                                get bored less easily, you focus more. You concentrate more. You can do more
                                repetitions. You can repeat more of the same thing. That‚Äôs great. So that‚Äôs one of the
                                key things, what we‚Äôve already talked about; managing your emotions
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Managing your beliefs will also help. Thinking constantly about what you want in the
                                end. Imagining yourself as a successful English speaker. All of these things are
                                building your energy. And that will help you repeat more often with more energy. But
                                there‚Äôs one more secret to repetition and this is something that all masters do and have
                                always done. It‚Äôs a key point to using repetition most powerfully. Because if you just
                                repeat and do the same thing, if you do it badly, well then you‚Äôre teaching
                                yourself to perform badly. If you practice English every day with no energy, repeating,
                                repeating, well you‚Äôll learn to be bored and tired when speaking English. And you don‚Äôt
                                want that. So here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to do
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                First, of course, you‚Äôre going to get yourself in that peak state again. Always, every
                                time before you listen to English, you‚Äôre going to manage your body, your physiology.
                                You‚Äôre going to move. You‚Äôre going to smile. You‚Äôre going to change your posture.
                                You‚Äôre going to breathe. You‚Äôre going to change your emotions. You‚Äôre going to change
                                your focus. You‚Äôre going to think about that big goal, all those great benefits to
                                speaking English. And you‚Äôre going to do your incantations. You‚Äôre going to say
                                ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a great English speaker‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting better and better with English every day.‚Äù
                                And now you‚Äôre feeling great. And you start to repeat. You say ‚ÄúOkay, now, I‚Äôm going to
                                listen to that story again. Again, 7 times, 12 times, 20 times, 50 times,
                                100 times.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                On the 100th time, how are you going to keep your energy still? Well, you‚Äôre going to
                                get in that peak state but you‚Äôre also going to change your focus. When you repeat, you
                                don‚Äôt just do the same exact thing. You find small distinctions each time. A
                                distinction is a difference, an important difference, okay? An important difference. So
                                you‚Äôre doing the same thing, maybe you‚Äôre listening to the same story, for example. But
                                you, with your mind, are doing something a little differently each time,
                                a different distinction each time. What do I mean? Let me give you an example. Let‚Äôs say
                                you listen to this lesson the first time. The first time you probably want to focus on
                                just understanding
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                You need to understand all the words I‚Äôm using. You need to understand my pronunciation.
                                You need to, most importantly, understand the whole meaning of this lesson, of what I‚Äôm
                                saying, the meaning, the basic meaning of the English I‚Äôm speaking. So the
                                first time you probably read and listen at the same time. And you‚Äôre
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                focused just on the meaning, just on understanding. Maybe you do that 1 time, maybe 4
                                times, maybe 10 times, it depends, everybody‚Äôs different. But eventually you start to
                                feel bored. Eventually you think ‚ÄúI understand this, I understand the meaning.
                                I know all these vocabulary words, no problem.‚Äù Most people will then change. They‚Äôll go
                                to a new lesson ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bored, I already know this vocabulary, time for a new lesson.‚Äù
                                That‚Äôs what most people do.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                But someone who is focused on being a master will not do that. They will stay with the
                                same lesson. What they will do is find a new distinction, an important difference, a new
                                way to focus. For example, you know now all of the vocabulary. You understand
                                easily. So next you change your focus, a new distinction. Next, you don‚Äôt focus on just
                                understanding. Next, you focus on speed. You decide ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to answer those
                                mini‚Äêstory questions very fast.‚Äù And it becomes a game
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So the first time maybe you answer somewhat slowly. The next time you listen you try to
                                get faster. Maybe you still need to pause, but you‚Äôre getting faster. The next time you
                                try to go faster, answer those questions more quickly. Then you try to not
                                use the pause button. Answer before I answer. And it becomes this game, a challenge.
                                It‚Äôs repetition, it‚Äôs the same thing again but now you have a new distinction, a new
                                focus, a little bit different way of repeating. First, you were focused on just
                                meaning and understanding. Now, you‚Äôre focused on speed, the speed of your response,
                                faster and faster and faster. And that‚Äôs kind of a game, it keeps your brain awake. It
                                keeps your brain alive. It keeps you learning with this same repetition.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Now eventually that will become boring. You‚Äôll get really fast. You‚Äôll become faster
                                than me. At that point you have two choices. You can stop and go to a new lesson, what
                                most people will do. But you are a master, you want to master English. So you will
                                not do that. You will continue repeating the same lesson but, what do you need now? A
                                new distinction, a slightly new way to focus on the same lesson.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So next, for example, you might focus on listening deeply and carefully to
                                pronunciation, to my pronunciation. What do I mean by that? I mean you listen carefully,
                                how do I pronounce each word? You especially listen to my intonation. Intonation is kind
                                of the music of a language, it‚Äôs when I go up and when I go down. It‚Äôs when I stretch a
                                word or say a word very quickly. All of those things are important. If you want to
                                improve your pronunciation you‚Äôve got to first listen very carefully. Not like
                                a normal person, just listening and hearing it.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                You have to really focus on the sounds. You want to hear the emotion in my voice. You
                                want to focus, when do I get loud and when do I get quiet. What do I stress, what do I
                                not stress. So that‚Äôs your next distinction, you‚Äôre going to focus on listening
                                very carefully. Not so much for meaning, you already know that, you‚Äôre going to focus
                                this time on the sound, the music. Pretend you are a musician and you want to hear the
                                notes, the rhythm, the small important sounds of my pronunciation. Hear everything.
                                So you do that again and again and again, 5 times, 10 times, 15 times, 20 times or more,
                                focused on pronunciation, each lesson, the main lesson, the mini-story lesson and the
                                repeated mini-story lesson with the questions. This time you‚Äôre focused
                                on pronunciation, listening, listening, listening super carefully. Very detailed
                                listening.
                            </p>

                                What‚Äôs going to happen eventually? You‚Äôre eventually going to get bored. Not in the
                                beginning, in the beginning it‚Äôs a new challenge. Your brain is awake and alive but this
                                will become easier and easier and finally you‚Äôll think ‚ÄúOh, I finished listening
                                to his pronunciation, I can hear it.‚Äù Now you have another choice. Is it time to go to
                                the new lesson or do you find a new distinction? Well, of course, you‚Äôre a master so
                                you‚Äôre going to find a new distinction, yet again, a new focus, a small difference,
                                something a little bit different to focus on using still the same lesson. You‚Äôve been
                                listening deeply for my pronunciation, well your next step is to imitate my
                                pronunciation, to imitate me. And to imitate means to copy perfectly.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So now what you‚Äôre going to do, you‚Äôre going to listen to me, after every sentence
                                you‚Äôre going to pause. And you‚Äôre going to say the same sentence. Now here‚Äôs what you do
                                not do. You do not do listen and repeat. So I say ‚ÄúHey, how's it going!?‚Äù You pause
                                ‚ÄúHey, how's it going..."‚Äù I mean that‚Äôs the normal school way of doing it, listen and
                                repeat. You‚Äôre not repeating, repeating has no power, repeating does nothing. You‚Äôre
                                imitating. Think like an actor or an actress. Your job is to be me, be Kale.
                                So when I say imitate, I mean copy everything. Copy my speech exactly, perfectly, the
                                sounds of the words, the exact pronunciation. That‚Äôs just the beginning. The whole
                                sentence, the words in the sentence, that‚Äôs easy, that‚Äôs just the beginning. I‚Äôm
                                talking about my intonation, the exact music. You were listening to it before, now
                                you‚Äôre going to do it.

                                So when I go up, you‚Äôre going to go up. And when I go down, you‚Äôre going to go down.
                                When I‚Äôm loud, you will speak loudly. When I‚Äôm quiet, you will speak quietly. You want
                                to sound like me, just like an actor. You want to copy my emotion. So when you
                                speak it has the same emotion and power as my speaking. Copy my accent. If you‚Äôre really
                                serious, copy how I move. You can‚Äôt see me but you can imagine how am I moving. Am I
                                standing stiff, not moving? Not usually. I usually move around a lot when
                                I‚Äôm speaking. My hands are moving. My face is moving. You should do that, too. That‚Äôs
                                the final distinction, imitation.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                You can do this with anybody, not just me. You can watch a movie and copy the actor or
                                actress, remember the movie strategy? And this is great because you have a picture to
                                look at, so you can definitely, you can copy how they‚Äôre moving their body, how
                                they‚Äôre moving as they speak. And then you‚Äôre going to copy exactly how they speak. When
                                they pause, you pause. When they‚Äôre loud, you are loud. When they stretch a word, you
                                stretch it. You copy everything. And that‚Äôs an even deeper distinction,
                                a deeper level of repetition.
                            </p>

                                So this is very important. This is how the masters do it. This is how Michael Jordan
                                gets better and better and better, or got better and better and better as a basketball
                                player. He didn‚Äôt just shoot, shoot, shoot, same thing every day. No, every week
                                or every month he changed his distinctions. He reached a certain level, he decided ‚ÄúI
                                want to go higher.‚Äù So he focused on something a little different. Same action, same
                                skill, but now he‚Äôs focusing on something even higher or something even deeper.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                And when that became easy, he found something else, something else that was new and he
                                went higher still. And he kept doing that endlessly. Same with Tiger Woods, same with
                                anyone who is really great at what they do. It‚Äôs what you did naturally as a native
                                speaker of your language. You didn‚Äôt know it, it was happening unconsciously,
                                intuitively, effortlessly. But it‚Äôs what you did as a child as you grew up. You were at
                                a certain level but then every day or every week or every month you focused on something
                                new, you got something new.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So that‚Äôs what I want you to do. This is your homework. This is your homework for life,
                                for the rest of your life, every day. You‚Äôre going to learn more deeply than other
                                people. You‚Äôre going to repeat more with more intensity. And the way you‚Äôre going
                                to do it is by always finding new distinctions. You can start with these stories now.
                                You‚Äôre going to go more slowly. And you can follow my plan. You can add more to this.
                                There‚Äôs always a new distinction. If imitating me becomes easy, think of something
                                else. Keep getting better and better. But for now, try my plan. So in the beginning
                                you‚Äôre going to listen for what?
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                For understanding, basically, that‚Äôs the first level of repetition. Listen for
                                understanding. Focus on the meaning, the general and specific meaning of what I‚Äôm
                                saying. And do that for as long as you can, until you can hear it and instantly know the
                                meaning,
                                no problem, no effort. When that becomes super easy, then you go to the next level, the
                                next distinction which is you‚Äôre going to focus on speed. You‚Äôre going to focus on
                                answering the mini-story questions faster and faster and faster and faster,
                                until you can beat me. What‚Äôs next? What‚Äôs the next distinction?
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                That becomes easy, then what do you do? Well then maybe after 50 or 100 repetitions with
                                the mini-stories going fast, then maybe you decide ‚ÄúWell, now I‚Äôm going to listen very,
                                very carefully and deeply to Kale‚Äôs pronunciation.‚Äù Every tiny detail of pronunciation,
                                the intonation, the individual sounds, the loudness, the pauses, the emotion.
                                Everything, carefully, carefully listening to the music of English, the music of my
                                speech. And you‚Äôll do that as many times as possible. And then finally you‚Äôll go to the
                                deepest distinction, the deepest for us right now, which is imitation. When that has
                                become easy, you will go on to imitate me perfectly. You will try to copy exactly my
                                pronunciation. Be me when you speak.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                By following this system for every single lesson you will get a lot more repetitions for
                                each lesson. Therefore, you‚Äôll learn it much more deeply. Not just a couple times then
                                on to the next one and forget it. You won‚Äôt forget this. You will never forget
                                this. If you follow this system, every lesson will be stuck in your brain 10 years from
                                now. You‚Äôll still remember it. I promise you but you have to follow this system.

                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Okay, then. Good luck. Keep finding those new distinctions, always, again and again and
                                again. Increase your repetition. Increase the intensity. And always go deeper, deeper,
                                deeper to a deeper level.

                                Seth had a dream. He wanted to be the best guitarist in the world. He wanted to be a

                                So, of course, he decided to find the best guitar coach in the world.

                                Kale was the best guitar coach in the world. Seth went to Kale and he said ‚ÄúKale, teach

                                Kale said ‚ÄúImitate me. Dress like me. Jump and yell and look cool like me. Then you‚Äôll
                                be the best guitarist in the world and a rock god.‚Äù

                                So, for one year every day Seth imitated Kale. He walked like Kale. He moved like Kale.

                                Next, he went to his friend, Heather. He said ‚ÄúHeather, how can I become the best
                                guitarist in the world? I tried to study with Kale but he sucked.‚Äù

                                Well Heather said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs vital to find a great player to model. Seek out Slash from Guns

                                So he did. He went looking for Slash. And finally he found him in Los Angeles.

                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                He asked Slash ‚ÄúSlash will you please teach me to be a great guitarist? I want to be a
                                rock god.‚Äù Slash said ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù So every day Slash showed Seth new key distinctions on the
                                guitar. He showed him key differences, key new things to learn.

                                Today‚Äôs lesson is called ‚ÄúIdentity.‚Äù Your identity is what you believe about yourself so
                                this topic is a little bit similar to the topic of beliefs. We‚Äôve talked a lot about
                                beliefs before remember? Limiting beliefs and empowering beliefs. Identity is
                                really an important kind of belief, it‚Äôs a collection of beliefs about yourself. The
                                reason this is important, more important than just normal beliefs, is because these are
                                global beliefs, universal beliefs
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Now by global I mean beliefs that affect everything. Global comes from globe which means
                                all of the world. Your global beliefs affect all your other beliefs. They influence all
                                your other beliefs. They influence all of your other emotions. They influence
                                everything. They‚Äôre kind of the most fundamental beliefs, the core, deepest beliefs, the
                                central beliefs. And other beliefs come from them
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So you‚Äôre already been thinking a lot about your beliefs related to English, for
                                example. But now I want you to think about the beliefs you have about yourself, who you
                                are. What kind of person you are, what your abilities are. These are very, very
                                important.
                                You need to choose them because most of us grow up and we learn them from other people.
                                We don‚Äôt even know its happening. For example, we grow up thinking we are citizens of a
                                certain country. And that‚Äôs true, of course it‚Äôs true. But if we identify
                                too much, if that belief is too strong, we can become negative, possibly even violent
                                towards people from other countries
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Someone could say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an American. I‚Äôm an American, America is number one! I‚Äôm the
                                best. Everyone else sucks.‚Äù Well, believe it or not, there are people in the United
                                States who think that. There are people like that in every country, in Colombia, in
                                Australia, in Sweden. Obviously this is not a positive belief, not positive for most
                                people. It has a lot of negative consequences
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So we‚Äôve got to be careful about our global beliefs, about what we believe about
                                ourself. More commonly, we have a lot of beliefs about what we can do and what we can't
                                do. We have beliefs about ourselves ‚ÄúI am this and I am not that.‚Äù I‚Äôll give you an
                                example of a typical limiting global belief that many of my students have. For many,
                                many, many years, some students had a belief ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a good language learner.‚Äù This was
                                a very strong belief that they had, a global belief about themselves. Now,
                                every time they tried to learn a new language, English for example, this belief was
                                there. Do you think it helped them learn English? No, it didn't. It had the opposite
                                effect. It frustrated them. It caused them to quit again and again and again.
                                And here‚Äôs what happens. They keep having this idea in their head from the past, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
                                not a good language learner. I‚Äôm a poor language learner.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So when they started to try to learn English, for example, what happened? Well, they
                                started learning. And unfortunately they were trying normal, traditional methods, not
                                Kale's methods. They know better now, but in the past they didn‚Äôt know. So they
                                were trying just these normal methods. And, of course, it was difficult. They had
                                problems. They made mistakes. It was difficult for them to understand. So what happened
                                is this experience touched, interacted with their global belief ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a good
                                language learner‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a poor language learner‚Äù which made these experiences even
                                more difficult. So, some of them looked at these experiences and decided the meaning was
                                ‚ÄúWell, see! I‚Äôm not a good language learner, of course. Of course English
                                is difficult because I‚Äôm not a good language learner.‚Äù So they quit
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Now another person can have the same experience. Let‚Äôs say somebody who has the belief
                                ‚ÄúI am a great language learner", like you! You love learning languages. You are
                                fantastic at languages. And you start to learn French or German and guess what happens?
                                You have some difficulties. You have trouble understanding, of course, you‚Äôre a
                                beginner. You‚Äôre just starting. Now you don‚Äôt think ‚ÄúOh, see, I can‚Äôt do it.‚Äù You think
                                ‚ÄúWell, this is normal but I‚Äôm a great language learner so I‚Äôm going to solve this
                                problem and keep going. I‚Äôm going to get better and better. This will improve.‚Äù Your
                                whole attitude is different. So when the same thing happens to you it doesn‚Äôt stop you.
                                It doesn‚Äôt hurt your emotions, your energy doesn‚Äôt drop. You don‚Äôt lose motivation.
                                You get stronger and better. You decide ‚ÄúWell, this is a short-term problem. I‚Äôm going
                                to solve it. I'm going to keep going.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So that‚Äôs the power of a global belief. It affects everything. Every specific experience
                                is filtered through the global beliefs. So every experience most students have gets
                                filtered through this belief ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a good language learner.‚Äù But if I you the
                                opposite belief, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a great language learner‚Äù, well then every experience will be
                                filtered through that
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Okay, so we need to choose our global beliefs. It‚Äôs very important. We need to develop
                                empowering global beliefs as well. Not just beliefs about English or beliefs about
                                specific things, but also beliefs about ourselves. Who we are, what we can do, what
                                kind of person we are. These are the most important kinds of beliefs, these global
                                identity beliefs. So you need to look at your own right now about English and learning
                                in general. Do you have limiting, negative global beliefs? What do you think
                                about yourself? Do you think ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm not good at English.‚Äù Or do you think ‚ÄúOh, I am a
                                fantastic English learner. I am a fantastic English speaker. I learn languages easily
                                and quickly.‚Äù Which one? It‚Äôs a big, big difference. It will have a big effect
                                which one you choose
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So let‚Äôs talk about how can you build up this identity? How can you choose your
                                identity? Well the first thing you need to decide, just rationally, very carefully, just
                                thinking logically, what kind of beliefs would help you? What kind of beliefs would
                                guarantee your success? Those are the ones you want to choose. Consciously choose the
                                beliefs you want about yourself. So go ahead right now, pause this. Get a piece of paper
                                and write down maybe three or four beliefs, positive, strong beliefs that
                                will change your feeling about yourself. Write down at least a couple that are related
                                to language learning and English learning, English speaking, and maybe just
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                some very general ones about yourself. And begin every sentence with ‚ÄúI am...‚Äù I am a
                                great language learner. I am a great English speaker. I am a fast learner, etc. Okay? So
                                four or five, I want you to write them down. Four or five positive empowering
                                global beliefs, identity beliefs. I am...something. And then after you finish, hit play
                                again and we‚Äôll continue. So pause right now and do this, real quick

                                You‚Äôre going to make those strong. And if you remember, the way we make a belief
                                stronger is we add references, we add experiences, we add evidence. We add specific
                                examples that show that it‚Äôs true. And here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to do. You‚Äôre going to
                                think back, think in your life. Think about a time, any time, one experience
                                where you succeeded. You did something that was difficult and you succeeded. And I want
                                you to write that down again. Pause really quickly, write down just one example.
                                Something you did that was difficult, you succeeded even though it was difficult.
                                Go ahead, pause, do it

                                Okay. Here‚Äôs what I want you to do now. Think again. We‚Äôre going to find another
                                reference, another example. Think back again in your life, any time in your life, now,
                                in the past, in the far past, as a child, last week, yesterday, doesn‚Äôt matter. I want
                                you to think about a time when you learned something...a time when you learned something
                                that seemed difficult. So you learned something, it might have seemed tough at the time,
                                but you did it. You learned it, a new skill, knowledge, anything. Just
                                think about successful times in your past when you learned something. And you should
                                have more than one so I would like you to write down four or five of these. Four or five
                                successful learning experiences, things that you learned. One example, we
                                all have, you learned your native language. You are a master of Spanish. Write that
                                down. And write down four or five other examples of successful learning in your past

                                Alright, did you do it? So now here we have, you have a list of examples. You have
                                examples of meeting a challenge, doing something difficult in your past. You have
                                examples of learning difficult things in your past. You have examples of succeeding with
                                English in your past. Review them, remember them. And the next step, with each one, one
                                by one, you‚Äôre going to remember these and you‚Äôre going to remember them vividly.
                                Remember that word? Vividly, colorfully, big, clear. So take the first one on
                                your list. A past challenge, something in the past that was difficult but you succeeded.
                                Imagine it. See it in your head right now. See the picture of yourself succeeding. Now
                                make that picture bigger. Bring it closer to you. Make it large. Make it
                                brighter. Make it brighter, more light, more light. More light, it‚Äôs big and it‚Äôs bright
                                now, this success that you had in your past. Now add color. See all the colors in this
                                picture. Make it very colorful. Remember all of the colors in this experience,
                                in this picture. It‚Äôs big. It‚Äôs bright. It‚Äôs colorful
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                And finally, associate with the picture. Associate, associate means you‚Äôre connected,
                                you‚Äôre in the picture. In psychology we can disassociate or we can associate.
                                Disassociate means you‚Äôre separate from something, an experience for example. It‚Äôs like
                                you‚Äôre looking at it from the outside. But if you associate with it, it means you‚Äôre in
                                it. You‚Äôre part of it. So I want you to associate with this picture. Step into the
                                picture. You are there again. There you are, in your body again in this successful
                                challenge. You did it successfully, something that was difficult. You‚Äôre there. It‚Äôs
                                big. It‚Äôs bright. It‚Äôs colorful. Remember every detail. Feel what you felt at that time.
                                Feel the feelings again. See what you saw. Hear what you heard. Live it again.

                                Now come back. Now the next one, choose again something on your list. A time when you
                                learned something difficult, you succeeded. It was difficult but you learned it, you
                                mastered it. And again, see the picture. Make that picture larger and larger and
                                larger. Turn it up again, brighter and brighter and brighter. Add color, make it more
                                colorful, more colorful. And finally, step into the picture. Associate with the
                                experience. Live it again. Be there again with this second experience. Successful
                                learning, you did it. Feel it. Feel how it felt. Live it again, breathe it again. Feels
                                good.

                                One more time, let‚Äôs do it again. From your list choose a successful English experience.
                                Anything, it can be small, it‚Äôs okay. It can be big, that‚Äôs fine, too. A time you did
                                something with English successfully, you understood. You spoke. You read something.
                                It doesn‚Äôt matter. But you had some kind of success with English in the past. I know you
                                have something. So pick one. Got it? And one more time, the same thing. See that
                                picture. See yourself succeeding. Speaking English or understanding it.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Live it again. See it. Now make that picture bigger, bigger, closer to you, closer to
                                you, closer, bigger, larger, larger, larger. Let‚Äôs add some light. Turn it up. Make it
                                brighter and brighter and brighter. A nice bright, large picture in your brain,
                                this successful experience from your past with English. Once again add color. It should
                                be a colorful picture. Remember the colors. See them clearly, distinctly, powerfully,
                                vividly. And the last step, step into the picture. Become part of the picture.
                                Associate with it. Be in that experience again. Live it again. Live it again, the
                                success with English. Feel what you felt. Feel the happiness. Feel the pride.

                                every time, every day. You pick something from your list. See it. Make it bigger.
                                Make it brighter, more colorful. And then step into it and live it again. Feel it again.
                                Do this every day this week. You‚Äôll start to change your global beliefs. You‚Äôll change
                                your identity. And just to be sure, make sure you write down those beliefs
                                ‚ÄúI am a fast learner of English. I am an excellent English speaker.‚Äù Write those down
                                and review them also. Through this process, by doing this just one week, maybe ten days,

                                English and see if it makes a difference. See how it will change your learning,
                                your confidence, your feelings when you learn English, when you speak English. You‚Äôll
                                feel stronger. You‚Äôll feel smarter. You‚Äôll feel more successful and you‚Äôll become more

                                understanding for a while, for a few days. Then try to be fast when you respond,
                                when you answer. Then listen very carefully for pronunciation. And finally, imitate me,
                                my voice, my emotion, everything. So you can do that for one or two weeks, at least,
                                possibly longer with each lesson. Then you‚Äôll learn very, very deeply. That‚Äôs
                                the power of the mini‚Äêstories. One time listening to them is nothing. It won‚Äôt help you
                                so much. But if you use that system, I promise you it will help a lot. You will learn so
                                much English grammar intuitively and naturally. And one day you‚Äôll start
                                speaking and you‚Äôll use correct grammar without thinking at all. But you have to follow
                                that system, so please follow the system correctly.

                                listen deeply. Remember to use those different distinctions, remember those? Listen for
                                understanding for a while, for a few days. Then try to be fast when you respond,
                                when you answer. Then listen very carefully for pronunciation. And finally, imitate me,
                                my voice, my emotion, everything. So you can do that for one or two weeks, at least,
                                possibly longer with each lesson. Then you‚Äôll learn very, very deeply. That‚Äôs
                                the power of the mini‚Äêstories. One time listening to them is nothing. It won‚Äôt help you
                                so much. But if you use that system, I promise you it will help a lot. You will learn so
                                much English grammar intuitively and naturally. And one day you‚Äôll start
                                speaking and you‚Äôll use correct grammar without thinking at all. But you have to follow
                                that system, so please follow the system correctly.

                                to the version with the questions, and then we‚Äôre going to add one more kind of
                                lesson, a point of view lesson. Remember chapter 4? The point of view lesson is really
                                great for learning grammar in an intuitive way. Just follow along, no stress. Remember,
                                shoulders back, chin up, deep breath, big smile. Let‚Äôs get started!

                                This lesson is called ‚ÄúThe Kaizen Way.‚Äù So we‚Äôre going to talk about a book. The book is
                                called The Kaizen Way by Robert Maurer. Now, kaizen is a Japanese word although we use
                                it in English now a little bit. Especially in Business you find it a lot, kaizen.
                                Kaizen means small improvements over time in Japanese. It really means constant and
                                neverending improvement. But it has this idea of making little tiny improvements again
                                and again and again and again, for one week, for one month, for one year, forever.
                                So kaizen is kind of the opposite of innovation.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Innovation means a sudden, big change, a sudden, big improvement. And that‚Äôs a great way
                                to learn and improve. For example, you could study English very intensely for one month
                                or two months and you would make a big, sudden improvement. That‚Äôs the innovation
                                idea, but there‚Äôs another way you can improve and that is the kaizen way. And the kaizen
                                way means maybe you just listen to English or read English or study English, maybe you
                                just do it 20 minutes every day. And every day you improve just a little
                                bit. But the key, the secret is you do it every single day. Every day you make one
                                little improvement. Well after one week, one month, one year, two years, five years, you
                                will make a huge change just by making little tiny improvements over time.
                                That‚Äôs the idea of kaizen.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So I‚Äôm going to read a little bit from The Kaizen Way, just a couple paragraphs, and
                                then I‚Äôll talk about it more. Okay, so here‚Äôs a section, it‚Äôs called Kaizen Tip and this
                                is from Robert Maurer, M-a-u-r-e-r, that‚Äôs his last name. Okay, Kaizen Tip:

                                ‚ÄúYou want to do something creative. Write a story or a song. Paint a picture. Dream up

                                takes, the hippocampus, which is the part of the brain that stores information, will
                                have no choice but to address it. And in its own way, on its own timetable, the brain
                                will begin giving you answers.‚Äù

                                Okay, that‚Äôs the section from The Kaizen Way, so this is very interesting from Robert
                                Maurer here. This technique of asking small questions to yourself is very powerful. You
                                can use it for anything. You can use it for learning English, of course. You
                                could ask yourself small questions every day. For example, how could I improve today
                                just a little bit? Or how could I improve my pronunciation 2% this week? The important
                                part of asking these questions is that they must be small questions. So don‚Äôt
                                say how could I be totally perfect with English in one month? That‚Äôs a huge question and
                                often you‚Äôll feel stress or worry or fear if you ask this gigantic, huge question.
                                You‚Äôll think, oh my god, I don‚Äôt know, can I do it?
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                But if you ask a very small question, it seems so small, so easy, your brain will say
                                ‚ÄúOh, I can do that, that‚Äôs easy.‚Äù And then you will start to take action. And, of
                                course, action is the most important part. Action is what we need. So if you try to
                                ask big questions, you‚Äôre trying to improve very fast and you will probably get
                                stressed. So maybe, it's better to change your strategy. Try the Kaizen way. Instead,
                                ask yourself little small questions. How could I improve just a little bit? How could
                                I learn just one new word each day? How could I improve my pronunciation just a tiny bit
                                each week? Ask yourself these little questions.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                And another point from this article, you need to repeat the questions again and again
                                and again. You have to ask this same question or questions every day for one week or two
                                weeks or maybe even a couple months. By asking yourself these questions again,
                                again, every day you‚Äôre asking the same question, your brain must come up with an
                                answer. Your brain must find an answer. It will find answers. Keep asking questions,
                                your brain will give you answers. It will give you better and better answers the
                                more you ask these small questions. So anytime you have some big goal, some big project
                                that seems so difficult, try the kaizen way. Try to approach this problem with little
                                small tiny improvements. Ask yourself little small easy questions every day,
                                again and again and again. Your brain will get more energy. It will find the answers.
                                You‚Äôll get momentum. You‚Äôll start to take action. And then after one month you‚Äôll take
                                bigger actions. After two to three months, bigger actions, bigger actions.
                                Actually these improvements start to grow. The improvements get bigger and faster and
                                faster. That‚Äôs the magic of the kaizen way. It seems so small and tiny. It seems so easy
                                but over time it builds. It grows stronger and stronger.

                                Now it‚Äôs time for the point of view stories. Now the point of view story, or stories
                                actually, are designed to teach you grammar intuitively, as you learned in Chapter 4.
                                Now, I'll repeat a few tips which are important to think about when you‚Äôre doing
                                this lesson. Or actually, there‚Äôs a few things that you need to know that you should not
                                think about and the number one thing you should not think about are grammar rules. Do
                                not think about grammar rules. Very important. Now I know you‚Äôve been taught
                                grammar rules for many years so it‚Äôs hard to get that out of your brain. But it‚Äôs very
                                hard to unlearn that information. Because you learned grammar in an analytical way
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                What that means is you intellectually learned grammar. You learned, okay, well the past
                                progressive is this and we use it in these specific situations and blah blah blah...and
                                you took all these grammar tests. And it totally confused your brain so that
                                when you actually speak, you don‚Äôt know how to speak with proper grammar. It comes out
                                wrong. You take a grammar test, maybe you do very well. But when you speak your grammar
                                sucks, it‚Äôs terrible! What‚Äôs the problem here? Well, it‚Äôs because you learned
                                grammar rules and terms. You studied it. You analyzed it. You memorized these rules. But
                                you didn‚Äôt learn it intuitively, naturally. It did not get deep into your brain the way
                                a native speaker knows grammar
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So the point of view stories are designed to teach you the way a native speaker learns
                                grammar. And we learn grammar by listening, by understanding meaning, by understanding
                                patterns. So when you listen to these stories, here‚Äôs the good news. Just listen.
                                Smile. Shoulders back. Feel great and just listen. Don‚Äôt think about anything. Don‚Äôt
                                think about rules, none of that. Just relax and enjoy the story. Notice the patterns.
                                You can notice the changes in vocabulary because in each story what I‚Äôm going
                                to do is I‚Äôm going to tell this exact same story from the mini‚Äêstory. So in this story
                                you‚Äôre going to hear the same story about Jan being rude. But I‚Äôm going to tell it from
                                a different point of view. It means from a different time
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So, for example, I might tell that story but from the future. I might say that I have an
                                idea for a movie and the movie will happen in ten years, ten years from now. In ten
                                years there will be a woman and she‚Äôll be very rude. Her name will be Jan. And
                                I‚Äôll tell the whole story from the point of view of the future. Of course, I‚Äôll change
                                some of the vocabulary, especially the verbs, in order to tell it from the future. Now
                                all you have to do is just listen to it. Just say ‚ÄúOkay, this is the future‚Äù
                                and just notice. All you have to do is just listen, notice some of the words change.
                                I‚Äôll be using will, for example, and you know that that‚Äôs the future tense. But forget
                                this idea of the future tense. Forget your grammar books. Just notice the changes
                                in vocabulary. Sometimes I might change the word order. Sometimes the structure might
                                change a little bit. Just notice it. That‚Äôs all you have to do. Listen carefully. Don‚Äôt
                                think about it. Don‚Äôt analyze it. Don‚Äôt write down rules, none of that. Listen
                                and notice, listen, listen, listen, that‚Äôs all you need to do
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Now in the point of view stories I‚Äôm going to use two basic points of view. One is the
                                future, which I just mentioned, and the other is the past. All you need to know is I‚Äôll
                                start most of those stories with something like ‚ÄúSince she was young... Since
                                2001...‚Äù Right, it means something started in the past and is continuing up until now
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So that‚Äôs one of the points of view I‚Äôll use and the other one will be the future. The
                                main mini‚Äêstory, you may have noticed, most of the regular mini‚Äêstories are from the
                                past. Right, I said Jan was very rude. She wanted to change. So I did that by design.
                                I did it on purpose. Because most people need a lot of help, a lot of practice, a lot of
                                listening for the past, the past, the past. So that‚Äôs why the main mini‚Äêstories are
                                almost always told from the past point of view. Alright, enough talking, let‚Äôs
                                get to it. Are you ready? Let‚Äôs start with the first one

                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                But one day, she invited all her friends. And she said ‚ÄúI will never be rude to you
                                again.‚Äù She was very friendly. She gave compliments to each one. She said ‚ÄúOh, ugh,
                                you‚Äôre very nice and you‚Äôre very intelligent.‚Äù She coughed them up. It was difficult
                                in the beginning. But then over the course of two years she was very, very kind. She was
                                always kind during that time. Over the course of two years she was very kind, kind,
                                kind, very friendly. And, of course, after two years everybody loved Jan.
                                They gave her kisses. They gave her money. They gave her love. And how did she feel? She
                                felt very fulfilled.
                            </p>

                                Okay, so this is the end of the first POV story. Now something happened in that story
                                and you should notice it. Don‚Äôt think about the grammar terms but just notice that
                                something changed, I don‚Äôt know, around the middle of the story. Now the beginning
                                of the story I was saying ‚ÄúSince she was a child she has been rude. She has always said
                                rude comments to people since she was a child.‚Äù And then I said ‚ÄúShe invited all her
                                friends one day.‚Äù One day she invited all her friends, right? Different vocabulary,
                                different point of view, the point of view suddenly changed. So in the beginning I‚Äôm
                                talking about since, since she was a child. Something started in the past
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                and then it continued. It kept happening again and again and again up until now or up
                                until a certain time. There is a range of time there. Started in the past and then kept
                                going over some time. But then it changed, it became a sudden one time event.
                                She invited her friends.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Now she didn‚Äôt keep inviting her friends every day for four years or for two years or
                                for one year or anything like that. It just happened. She invited her friends, boom, it
                                was a one time event. She did it, it happened, it finished. So then I changed.
                                And, you know, all you grammar people already know, I started using the past tense,
                                right? So don‚Äôt think about that, don‚Äôt worry about it. The point is that it changed.
                                And you‚Äôll notice that happening in most of the POV stories when I‚Äôm starting
                                with ‚ÄúSince 2003...‚Äù or ‚ÄúSince she was a child‚Äù you‚Äôll notice that often, probably most
                                of the stories I‚Äôll start that way and then something will happen.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Suddenly I‚Äôll talk about one single event and it will change. The point of view will
                                change. Just notice that. In each of those point of view stories in the future, this one
                                and all the other ones. Just notice when it changes. That‚Äôs all you need to do.
                                You don‚Äôt need to think about the grammar. You don‚Äôt need to think ‚ÄúOh, he went from the
                                present perfect to the past tense.‚Äù Don‚Äôt need to worry about that. Just notice the
                                change. And notice when it happens and that‚Äôs all you need to know.

                                Of course, this will be very tough for her in the beginning. She‚Äôll have to cough up the

                                Alright, that‚Äôs it. So easy. Now just a couple of things to notice in these future point
                                of view stories. One thing to notice is a little difficult to hear sometimes is this
                                ‚Äúll‚Äù sound, its that L sound, right? Sometimes I‚Äôll say, for example ‚ÄúJan‚Äôll
                                be very rude.‚Äù Of course that means Jan will be very rude. But in real conversation,
                                normal conversation, we often will just say ‚Äúll‚Äù, we add ‚Äúll‚Äù to something for the
                                future. Jan‚Äôll be very happy. Jan‚Äôll be very fulfilled. That ‚Äúll‚Äù, ‚Äúll‚Äù, ‚Äúll‚Äù.
                                You don‚Äôt need to say that, it‚Äôs maybe difficult to pronounce so it‚Äôs okay if you can‚Äôt
                                say it.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Just say will or gonna or going to, but you do need to be able to hear it so that you
                                understand what‚Äôs happening. You understand someone is talking about the future,
                                something that hasn‚Äôt happened yet. So listen for that ‚Äúll‚Äù, that ‚Äúll‚Äù is a little bit
                                difficult to hear sometimes so you have to listen carefully. So in these future stories
                                listen for the ‚Äúll‚Äù, Jan‚Äôll, they‚Äôll. Okay?
                            </p>

                                Another one is gonna. Now "gonna" means "going to". I am going to eat this food
                                tomorrow. Now that‚Äôs what you learned in your textbook, I‚Äôm going to. But what we
                                actually say very often in real conversation ‚Äì we say gonna. I‚Äôm gonna eat this food
                                tomorrow.
                                I‚Äôm gonna go to the store tomorrow. So gonna means going to or will, it means future,
                                future, future.

                                This lesson is called ‚ÄúThe Power of Reading‚Äù and it comes from an article by

                                Dr. Stephen Krashen. He‚Äôs one of my favorite people in the world.

                                Dr. Stephen Krashen is probably the number one expert on language learning and language
                                teaching in the world. He is just an incredible professor, an incredible researcher, an
                                incredible intellectual. He has done an incredible amount of research on the
                                topic of learning languages. And today we‚Äôre going to talk about just one part of his
                                research. Really, RAIO is based a lot on Dr. Stephen Krashen‚Äôs research, all of the
                                methods we use. But we‚Äôre going to talk about just one particular method, one
                                particular idea, very strong idea that comes from Dr. Stephen Krashen and his research
                                and that is the power of reading. Specifically it‚Äôs the power of pleasure reading. It‚Äôs
                                the power of easy reading. We‚Äôll talk about that more in a minute.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                But first let me read a little bit from this article. Now this article, as you might
                                guess, is about the power of reading. And Dr. Krashen did a lot of research about
                                reading. Specifically about how do people, native speakers, and people learning foreign
                                languages, how do they learn vocabulary? How do they get good grammar? How do they get
                                excellent writing skills? One of the most important methods to use when you've reached
                                conversational fluency is reading. Reading for pleasure. Now when we talk
                                about reading there are kind of two different ways to learn reading, even for small
                                children, learning a native language. Now one method, the old method, is that you learn
                                reading skills. So you have to study and analyze vocabulary, for example.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Spelling in English is very difficult and tough so they force us to study that a lot in
                                school. Well, we don‚Äôt have to but often with old methods and old teachers we do. We
                                study, study, study spelling. We study, study, study vocabulary. And we learn
                                all these skills. We use all these textbooks to learn reading. And, of course, people
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                learning new language, a foreign language, well guess what. You do the same things,
                                right? You learn textbooks. You‚Äôre reading all these textbooks and you‚Äôre trying to
                                learn all these ‚Äúreading skills.‚Äù
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                This is totally bad.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                The other way, the other method, and this is the method in fact that works much, much
                                better according to Dr. Krashen‚Äôs research, according to a lot of other research. It‚Äôs
                                just reading for fun, imagine that! And what that means is reading a lot of easy
                                and fun books. Now for children that might be comic books. It might be just children‚Äôs
                                novels. And it‚Äôs just reading, reading, reading, in other words we learn to read by
                                reading. We learn vocabulary from reading. We learn a lot of our grammar from
                                reading. We learn our writing skills from reading. Not by analyzing and studying
                                grammar. Not be trying to memorize vocabulary. If you read something very easy, you know
                                most of the words. And then you find a new word, you don‚Äôt need to memorize it.
                                You will start to understand that word just because you understand the general meaning
                                of the story. You understand the whole paragraph. You understand the sentence.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So that one word you can guess the meaning. And then guess what happens? You see that
                                new word again somewhere else in the book. And then you start, it‚Äôs in a different
                                situation. A little bit different paragraph, a little bit different sentence, and
                                now you‚Äôre ‚ÄúAh‚Äù you understand it a little more. Then you see it again in another
                                paragraph, somewhere else in the book. And over time you will naturally learn that word.
                                You‚Äôll never try to memorize it. You will never study it but you will learn
                                it. You will know it forever. That‚Äôs the best way to learn vocabulary, even better than
                                using ANKI. There‚Äôs a lot of research about this. The people who learn most vocabulary
                                and grammar at an intermediate level are the ones who just read easy books
                                all the time. They‚Äôre reading novels all the time. They‚Äôre reading, reading, reading.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Which group of people learns more vocabulary faster? The readers, the people who are
                                just reading for fun. They‚Äôre just reading a lot of fun, easy novels and books. Those
                                people have much bigger vocabularies than people who are actually trying to study
                                vocabulary. We use ANKI to memorize new words fast so we can start speaking fast, and
                                focus on auditory learning until we reach conversational fluency, until we can have
                                conversations. But then, a super efficient method to improve faster is reading.
                                And it‚Äôs the same for grammar. There are people who are studying grammar, study, study
                                grammar rules, study grammar textbooks and then there are other people who are just
                                reading lots of novels. They‚Äôre reading, reading, reading all the time. Comic
                                books, novels, articles, stories, the readers have better grammar than the people who
                                are studying grammar from textbooks. It‚Äôs a huge difference. And the more you read over
                                time, the bigger the difference. The better your grammar gets compared to
                                people who aren't. So this is a huge topic. It is so important.
                            </p>

                                So let me read a little bit from Dr. Krashen and then we‚Äôll talk a little more. Okay,
                                this is from Dr. Krashen:

                                ‚ÄúWhen second language learners read for pleasure, they develop the competence they need
                                to move from the beginning ordinary conversational level to a level where they can use
                                the second language for more demanding purposes. Such as the serious study of
                                literature, business, marketing and so on. When they read for pleasure they can continue
                                to improve in their second language without classes, without teachers, without study.
                                And even without people to talk with.

                                When we read we really have no choice. We must develop literacy. We rarely find
                                well‚Äêread people who have serious problems with grammar, spelling and so on. They write
                                acceptably well because they can‚Äôt help it. They have subconsciously acquired good
                                writing style as well as the conventions of writing. Our problem in language education,
                                is that we have confused cause and effect. We have assumed that we first learn language
                                skills and then apply these skills to reading and writing. But that is
                                not the way the human brain works. Rather, reading for meaning, reading about things
                                that matter to us is one of the real causes of language development.‚Äù
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So, very interesting, what does that mean? So what it means is that you don‚Äôt first
                                learn skills, like writing skills, spelling skills, learning how to form a sentence and
                                then a paragraph. And then later learning to read and write well. That‚Äôs exactly
                                the opposite of what actually happens. What actually happens is you read and you read
                                and you read. You read sentences. You read paragraphs. You read stories. You read books.
                                You read novels. And after reading so much you subconsciously, you intuitively
                                acquire, get, learn great reading skills, great writing skills, great vocabulary, great
                                grammar. It comes from reading a lot for pleasure. The reading comes first, then comes
                                writing.

                                This article is about reading but, in fact, listening is the same thing. So first you‚Äôre
                                listening a lot, that‚Äôs the first step. And you need to do lot of it, remember? You‚Äôve
                                got listen for pleasure, for fun, a lot, a lot, a lot. Now the good news is
                                you have to do it a lot but it‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs easy. You‚Äôre listening to stuff you like, a
                                specific music artist, a specific movie, audiobooks, podcasts, my crazy stories etc., so

                                You‚Äôre not thinking about grammar rules. You‚Äôre not thinking about vocabulary. You‚Äôre

                                you listen to, let's say a sentence in a song or a word in one of these stories,
                                you can simply look it up through Google Translate, the Cambridge Dictionary or
                                Reverso.net. You do that first so you understand the meaning of the sentence and the
                                song/movie/story, the grammar skills then come later. They come from the listening
                                and also the reading. The writing skills come from reading a lot. Your vocabulary comes
                                from reading a lot and listening, too. Your pronunciation comes from listening a lot.
                                It‚Äôs the input that is the most important. And specific kind of input, it‚Äôs
                                got to be meaningful, real, enjoyable, pleasurable. So that‚Äôs the power of reading.

                                What does easy mean for you? My rule is you should not need a dictionary to read and

                                Stephen King, the famous writer in the United States. You get a Stephen King book, in
                                English of course, and you start reading it but, oh, there‚Äôs so many words you don‚Äôt
                                know. And you need to use a dictionary all the time to understand. You get your
                                dictionary and you‚Äôre looking up all these words. Well, it‚Äôs too difficult for you. If
                                you need a dictionary to understand it, it‚Äôs too difficult. I did this mistake when I
                                thought I was good enough in Spanish. I bought "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho.
                                They said it was easy to read. But the book had a LOT of vocabulary that I didn't know,
                                so it took me forever to read the book because I had to stop after every sentence and
                                look up words. If that happens to you as well, stop. That's too hard. You
                                need to be able understand the whole book, the concept, the story, the meaning and the
                                moral of story, without a dictionary or Google Translate.

                                Okay, so, you know, put it aside and wait. You can read it later when your reading
                                skills are higher. But for now, find an easier book.

                                If you have kids, I'd recommend children‚Äôs novels. I say "if you have kids" because then
                                it's probably more likely that you will enjoy the novels, because you could read them to
                                your children later. But, even if you don't have kids, as long as you enjoy
                                them, they can be a fantastic way to learn. Remember, you have to enjoy it. If it sucks,
                                stop. Choose something else that you enjoy. There has to be emotion! Remember? Always
                                emotion. Get a sex novel if you like! Those are filled with emotion........

                                You can get the Goosebumps books for example. There‚Äôs a whole series. They‚Äôre for kids.
                                They‚Äôre called Goosebumps. And there‚Äôs, I don‚Äôt know how many, there‚Äôs probably 30 or 50
                                of them, okay? They‚Äôre short and they‚Äôre pretty easy. You can probably read
                                them without a dictionary. What you should do is read all of them. Read all 30 of them.
                                Read them, just enjoy them. Don‚Äôt use a dictionary. If you see a word you don‚Äôt know,
                                just guess the meaning and keep reading. If you‚Äôre wrong, it doesn‚Äôt matter.
                                You‚Äôll see that word again and again and again. Eventually you will understand that
                                word. You won‚Äôt need a dictionary. Just enjoy the story.

                                Another set of books I like are The Hardy Boys books. These are probably 50 years old.
                                And there‚Äôs another series of books called Nancy Drew. So The Hardy Boys books and the
                                Nancy Drew books, another set of kids books, kids novels, they‚Äôre fairly long
                                but not too long, that are really great if you want to do a lot of pleasure reading that
                                does not require a dictionary. So again, Nancy Drew books and The Hardy Boys books, and
                                again, there are so many of them, 20, 30 or more in each series. You can
                                read the whole series if you want to. And of course you can just go to any bookstore
                                that has English books.

                                Look in the children‚Äôs section or the young adults‚Äô section. Another series of books I
                                like, or actually I LOVE them, they are by Roald Dahl. I read Roald Dahl books in
                                Swedish when I was a child. They're awesome! Dahl is a Scandinavian name, hehe! D-a-h-l.
                                Anyway, he wrote books such a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant
                                Peach. He‚Äôs got a lot of books so you could look for some of those. And, of course,
                                there are movies that go with those books so you could watch the movies, too,
                                and listen to them. You can also get audiobooks. This is something I think is really
                                great. If you can find an audiobook and a regular book you can read it and then you can
                                listen to it at the same time. Remember, using transcripts to your audios
                                is a great way to speed up your learning, and then you repeat without the transcript and
                                BOOM! Expert in English in notime!
                            </p>

                                So read a lot offun stuff. And after you finish all The Hardy Boys books and after you
                                finish all the Goosebumps books and all the books by Roald Dahl, then find a book maybe
                                by Stephen King. OR maybe if that‚Äôs still too difficult, then find something
                                for young adults. And then read a lot of those books. Eventually, probably within one
                                year‚Äôs time if you‚Äôre reading all the time, if you‚Äôre reading every day, within one year
                                you‚Äôll be reading adult novels. You‚Äôll be reading the same books that I
                                read for pleasure, for fun, that native speakers read. But don‚Äôt start there. Go back
                                and just start with easy novels and read and read and read. Your grammar will improve
                                automatically and effortlessly. Your vocabulary will explode, it will increase
                                so much so fast. You won‚Äôt believe it. It‚Äôs amazing. So please, follow this. Reading is
                                so powerful but it has to be reading for fun, reading for pleasure.

                                No, no he didn‚Äôt. Not in 2001. In 2001 and before he never shot mosquitoes, but since
                                2002 he has liked to shoot mosquitoes with his gun. He has loved it, in fact. Since 2002
                                Filbert the monkey has loved to shoot mosquitoes with his gun. From 2002 right
                                up until almost now, during that whole time. So since 2002 he has enjoyed shooting
                                mosquitoes.

                                Since 2003 he has had total competence with his rifle, with his big long gun.

                                Filbert the monkey has also been a very well read monkey for many years. For many years
                                he has read philosophy books, every day reading about philosophy and shooting his gun at
                                the same time, pow, pow, pow, read, pow, pow, pow, read. He has been a very well read

                                This lesson is called ‚ÄúUnlimited Power.‚Äù Great title and of course it comes from the
                                book by Tony Robbins who is another one of my favorite coaches. In fact, I really love
                                Tony. He is fantastic and I highly recommend his books, his audios, his
                                seminars...anything you can get from Tony Robbins...fantastic!

                                And we‚Äôre going to go through a little section from one of his books and this section
                                talks about the number one trait that determines success and happiness in Tony Robbins‚Äô
                                opinion, and I agree with him. And that number one trait, that one factor, that

                                one thing that really creates success and powers and gives energy to everything else, it
                                is passion. So this is a little section about passion from Tony Robbins‚Äô book, Unlimited
                                Power. So I am just going to go ahead and read that section and then I will talk about
                                it more. So here we go.

                                Success is not an accident. The difference between people who produce positive results
                                and those who do not is not random. There are consistent logical patterns of action,
                                specific pathways to excellence that are within the reach of us all. We can unleash the
                                magic within us. We simply must learn how to turn on and use our minds and bodies in the
                                most powerful and advantageous ways. Have you ever wondered what a Steven Spielberg or a
                                Bruce Springsteen might have in common? What do John F. Kennedy and a Martin Luther King
                                share that caused them to affect so many people in such a deep and emotional way?

                                accomplishment of their dreams. But what is it that got them to continue day after day,
                                to put everything they‚Äôve got into everything they do?

                                There are of course many factors however I believe there are fundamental character
                                traits that they have cultivated within themselves. Characteristics that give them the
                                fire to do whatever it takes to succeed. These are the traits that can insure your
                                success as well. Trait number one: Passion. All of these people have discovered a
                                reason, a consuming, energizing, almost obsessive purpose that drives them to do, to
                                grow and to be more. It gives them the fuel that powers their success and causes them to
                                tap their true potential.

                                that people want in their relationships. Passion gives power and meaning. There is no

                                Okay, whew! So Tony Robbins, you can tell he‚Äôs a very passionate guy himself, very, very
                                passionate. And I really love this section because all the things we‚Äôve talked about
                                until now, they really are about passion. Changing your body, changing your focus,
                                changing your beliefs, what you are doing is finding that passion inside of you. That
                                energy, that incredible physical and mental and emotional energy that will help you
                                succeed at anything.
                            </p>

                                Without energy, it‚Äôs hard to succeed. Without energy, it‚Äôs hard to do anything. If you
                                have no energy, you can‚Äôt exercise. If you have no energy, probably your relationships
                                will be bad. If you have no energy, you‚Äôre not going to learn English very well, you‚Äôre
                                not going to learn anything very well. If you have no energy, you‚Äôre not going to be a
                                good teacher. You‚Äôre not going to be a good father, you‚Äôre not going to be a good
                                mother, nothing in your life will be excellent or even very good if you don‚Äôt have that
                                energy and that passion. The passion drives everything else. It‚Äôs the fuel, it‚Äôs like
                                the gasoline for your engine, for everything.

                                And so, to learn English, for example, you need to develop a passion for English,
                                exciting reasons to learn English. Not just take a test, taking a test, who gets excited
                                about taking a test? Almost nobody. In fact, usually it‚Äôs the opposite, right? Most of
                                us get stressed about taking a test. Most of us have fear about taking tests. And it‚Äôs
                                the same in schools, not just English. All of education, in almost every country, kills
                                passion. Most classrooms, high school, elementary school, middle school, university,
                                they kill passion, they kill that energy in the student unfortunately. It probably
                                happened to you, it certainly happened to me when I was growing up. It‚Äôs happened to
                                99.9% of the students I have taught. When they come to me their passion has been
                                diminished, lessened or even almost killed.

                                The good news is it‚Äôs never completely killed. You can find it again. Because naturally
                                as human beings we love to learn, our brains love learning. So sitting in little desks
                                and taking tests and being criticized by teachers and getting grades, all that bullshit,
                                all that crap, it kills passion, it may have killed the passion in you so just forget
                                about it. That part of your life is over. Thank god, yes, it‚Äôs over. Now you‚Äôre in
                                charge, now you are responsible. Now you are learning because you want to learn, so do
                                it in a way that gives you that passion, that gives you that excitement.

                                fun...date someone from another country because of your great English skills. That would
                                be great. If you‚Äôre a businessperson or want to be one, maybe you could make tons of

                                schools, but in a much better way, a way that excites them so that your children have

                                body just like Kale Anders‚Äô. And so every day he went to the gym. Every day he ran.
                                Every day he worked out. Every day he ate vegetables and finally one day after two
                                months, a breakthrough, a sudden big change. He got a perfect body. His body was exactly
                                like Kale‚Äôs. And then tens of thousands gay men and straight women wanted his hot, sexy
                                body. Marco was very, very happy.

                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                This one is called ‚ÄúHealthy at 100.‚Äù Healthy at 100 is the name of a book by John
                                Robbins. It‚Äôs a fantastic book, very interesting and the topic of this book is exactly
                                what the title says: How to be a healthy person at the age of 100, which seems kind of
                                amazing to most people. Can you be healthy? Can you be strong? Can you have energy when
                                you‚Äôre 100 years old? And the answer is absolutely yes.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Now, how did John Robbins write this book? It‚Äôs very interesting. Well, what he did,
                                personally and then with his research assistants, he studied cultures, places in the
                                world where large numbers of people live to be very old. But not only just live to be
                                old, because, y‚Äôknow, if you live to be old but you‚Äôre weak, that‚Äôs not very fun...
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                So he studied places that had a lot of very old people who were also very strong, very
                                energetic, very healthy, very happy. There‚Äôs a big difference if you‚Äôre 90 years old and
                                you‚Äôre in a nursing home and you‚Äôre weak and sick, and ugh. That‚Äôs a terrible life. But
                                if you‚Äôre 90 years old and you‚Äôre out running and you feel great, well that‚Äôs fantastic.
                                And there are cultures like this and there are also a lot of individual people like
                                this. And when I say a lot, I don‚Äôt mean a lot by percentage. It‚Äôs a small percent of
                                the human population. But still there are thousands of these kind of people, I don‚Äôt
                                know, maybe
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                hundreds of thousands, maybe millions. I‚Äôm not sure what the exact number is. But you
                                can find these people. You can find specific cultures where there are a lot of them. And
                                then you can find individuals.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                And so John Robbins was very curious about this and he wanted to know why. Why, why do
                                some people live strong, long, healthy, active lives for a very, very long time? Why are
                                some people so strong when they‚Äôre older and live so much longer? And then other people,
                                y‚Äôknow, they‚Äôre 60 years old, they‚Äôre already tired and sick. What‚Äôs the difference is
                                what he wanted to know. And so he studied different groups. One of the groups were
                                people, traditional people, on the island of Okinawa, Japan.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                Okinawa now has a lot of modern culture, a lot of American influence. And those people
                                do not live so long. And they‚Äôre not so healthy. But the kind of people who live on
                                Okinawa in a traditional way, the way they always have for a very long time, those
                                people are very special. They live very long lives and they‚Äôre very strong and healthy.
                                They‚Äôre still working when they‚Äôre 80 or 90 years old, working like on farms, like hard,
                                physical work.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                He studied another group of people in Pakistan, same thing. They lived to be 90, 100,
                                over 100, and the whole time they‚Äôre working, doing heavy, hard, physical work. It‚Äôs
                                pretty amazing. And then another thing they did is they studied individual people.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                There are just certain people, for example one of my favorites, one of my favorite
                                teachers, he‚Äôs dead now but I think he‚Äôs a great example. And his name is Paul Bragg.
                                Paul Bragg was in America one of the first people to start health food stores. He kind
                                of started the health movement in America. He was one of the first people to start
                                eating organic food, for example. Well Paul Bragg, he is very interesting. He died when
                                he was, I believe, 96 years old.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                You know, that‚Äôs pretty good itself, he lived to be 96. But here‚Äôs the cool part, this
                                is the part I love. How did he die when he was in 96? Was he in a bed sick with cancer?
                                No, he was surfing. He was surfing when he was 96 years old and it was a surfing
                                accident. Like I don‚Äôt know what happened. I guess he was surfing and he fell off the
                                board and another surfboard hit him in the head or he hit a rock or something. You know,
                                it‚Äôs sad that he died, of course. But he died active. He‚Äôs out on the waves surfing in
                                the ocean. And he‚Äôs 96 years old. Awesome!
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-left mt-2">
                                We can find a lot of people like this actually. And what‚Äôs really interesting when you
                                compare these different peoples in Okinawa, in Pakistan, other parts of the world, they
                                have similar things. They‚Äôre all doing similar things. There‚Äôs a reason. It‚Äôs not
                                random, remember that word? It‚Äôs not random. It‚Äôs not luck. And it‚Äôs not because of
                                their family members, because Paul Bragg‚Äôs father and mother didn‚Äôt live really long and
                                really strong.

                                It‚Äôs something they are doing. So that‚Äôs what this book is about, Healthy at 100. And
                                one of the things they study in the book is cancer. Why do some people get cancer at a
                                high rate and other people very, very low rate of cancer?
                            </p>

                                They eat very little meat. They almost never drink milk or dairy products or eat cheese.
                                They are eating a lot of fresh organic vegetables basically. And, of course, fruit as
                                well. I mean that‚Äôs the big secret. Yes, you‚Äôve got to exercise and move your body.
                                That‚Äôs another part. He talks about that diet is one big factor but also moving your
                                body and getting a lot of exercise and physical activity, of course, is very important
                                as well. Those two factors are the biggest factors in determining how long you will
                                live, how healthy you will be, how strong you will be, how much energy you will have in
                                your body.

                                He decided to get thin. So he stopped eating dairy products and he said ‚ÄúNo more

                                Then he studied other stars. He studied them very carefully. And he saw a correlation, a
                                connection, between big teeth and being a famous movie star. Now, unfortunately he has
                                always had tiny teeth, I mean since he was born. He has had tiny teeth since he was
                                born.

                                Well, since he was born, since he was a tiny baby. Starting when he was a tiny baby
                                until age 38, he has always had little tiny teeth.
                            </p>

                                But he decided to change that also. He got an operation from a dentist and the dentist
                                gave him huge freakin' teeth.
                            </p>

                                And so, one year later, Joe became the biggest, most famous movie star in the world

                                Alright, that‚Äôs the end of our first point of view story. You notice the change a couple
                                times, right? I started with "has wanted to be". Since he was 16, has wanted to be. And
                                then we say he decided, boom, just happened. And then we went back again and we said
                                since he was a baby he has had tiny teeth, starting when he was a baby until now, well
                                until 38. And then we change back again. Got an operation, gave him big teeth. Just
                                notice the changes. That‚Äôs all you need to do. You don‚Äôt need to remember the name of
                                the grammar terms or rules. Don‚Äôt remember any of that, doesn‚Äôt matter. Notice the
                                changes. Notice when they change, how they change. That‚Äôs all you need to do. Don‚Äôt
                                analyze it. Don‚Äôt think about it. Just notice it. Hear it. Listen to it. That‚Äôs all you
                                need to do. Relax

                                Well, first he‚Äôs going to decide to get thin. He‚Äôll stop eating dairy products. He‚Äôll

                                Next he‚Äôs gonna study famous movie stars and he‚Äôll see a correlation between big teeth
